  <h2 class='c004'>AMERICAN-IRISH HISTORICAL SOCIETY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>The American-Irish Historical Society was founded, as its
constitution declares, for “the study of American history generally;
to investigate specially the immigration of the people
of Ireland to this country, determine its numbers, examine the
sources, learn the places of its settlement; to examine records
of every character wherever found; to endeavor to correct
erroneous, distorted, and false views of history in relation to
the Irish race in America; to encourage and assist the formation
of local societies; to promote and foster an honorable and
national spirit of patriotism; to place the result of its historical
investigations and researches in acceptable literary form;
to print, publish, and distribute its documents; to sift and
discriminate every paper, sketch, document bearing on the
society’s line of work, before the same is accepted and given
official sanction.” The work was inaugurated by the issuance
of the following invitation to prominent men throughout the
country:</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>A Call for the Organization of an American Historical
Society whose Special Line of Research shall be the
History of the Irish Element in the Composition of
the American People.</span></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Dear Sir</span>,—A number of gentlemen, interested in the part taken
in American history by people of Irish birth or lineage, are about
to organize themselves into an historical society for the purpose
of investigating and recording the influence of that element in the
up-building of the nation.</p>

<p class='c007'>People of Irish blood have been coming to this continent, voluntarily
and otherwise, since the date of its earliest settlement. While
they have been a valuable addition to colony and republic in all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>departments of human activity, their work and contributions have
received but scant recognition from chroniclers of American history.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whether this omission springs from carelessness, ignorance, indifference,
or design, is now of little moment. The fact that such a
condition does exist makes it imperative that it should be remedied
not only in the interest of historical truth, but of racial fair play.
Certain elements in the make-up of the American people have not
hesitated on occasion to masquerade, at the expense of the Irish,
in borrowed plumes, and to pose under plundered laurels. It is
the duty of honest historians to look after the rights of the lawful
owners.</p>

<p class='c007'>The history of Irish immigration to this country is of profound
interest. The motive that inspired this sturdy people in coming to
these shores was largely the one that animated and inspired all
immigration—discontent with the existing home conditions, civil,
religious, political, industrial, and the hope of living under better
and nobler conditions here.</p>

<p class='c007'>The American of English stock has his historical society; the
descendants of the Dutch, Huguenot, and Spaniard have associations
which specialize the historical work of the bodies they represent;
and we feel that the story of the Irish element should be told
before the mass of legend and fiction now flooding the country under
misleading designations has completely submerged historic facts.</p>

<p class='c007'>The work of our projected society will be influenced by no religious
or political divisions, for with us the race stands first, its qualifying
incidents afterwards. It matters little where the people came
from, whether from the north, the south, the east, or the west of
Ireland. It is of minor importance in what church they worshiped;
we wish merely to concern ourselves with the work done by them
here; to record the story of their settlement; to state the extent of
their participation in the civil, military, and political activities of the
land, and to try truthfully and fearlessly to record their achievements.</p>

<p class='c007'>The society now in process of formation must, we believe, be
made up of men who have the patience to search, the knowledge
and wisdom to sift and discriminate, and the ability to place the
results in acceptable literary form. Lastly, the character of the
membership must be such that it will command the respect and
attention of the community, so that its work will be accepted as
having a definite historical value which can be used in general
works treating of the growth of the republic by historians of a
future date. This, in brief, is the project; it is ambitious, but it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>worthy; it is absolutely necessary if the good name and influence of
an essential, but much neglected, chapter in American history shall
be perpetuated.</p>

<p class='c007'>To place the Irish element in its true light in American history,
to secure its correct perspective in relation to historic events on this
soil, is the final aim of the new society. Its primal object will be to
ascertain the facts, weigh them in relation to contemporary events,
and estimate their historical value, avoiding in this process the
exaggeration and extravagance of poorly informed writers on the
one hand and the prejudice and misrepresentation of hostile writers
on the other.</p>

<p class='c007'>The organization will be constructed on a broad and liberal plan.
It will be non-political, and no religious test will be required for
admission to membership or the holding of office. Being an American
organization in spirit and principle, the society will welcome to
its ranks Americans of whatever race descent who evince an interest
in the special line of research for which the society is organized.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some of the projectors belong to other historical bodies, and it
was at first believed that the work for which this new society is to
be formed could better be done through the medium of those bodies
and without the necessity of a separate organization. Experience,
however, has led to the conclusion that this is not so. Hence the
resolve to form a distinct body, with its own special object, program,
and mode of procedure.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is a place for such a society in the community; its purposes
are honorable and useful, and its work should begin while yet documents,
records, and historical material are available. We feel that
such a work will be valuable not only to the Irish race, but to the
American race also, to whose fiber this element has contributed its
share.</p>

<p class='c007'>We will be glad to have your good wishes and coöperation in the
work.</p>

<p class='c007'>The meeting for organizing the society will be held at the Revere
House in Boston, Mass., on Wednesday, Jan. 20, 1897, at 6.30 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>
Introductory to the proceedings, a dinner will be served.</p>

<hr class='c009' />

<p class='c000'>The following constitution was adopted:</p>

<h3 class='c010'><em>Preamble.</em></h3>

<p class='c011'>Believing that the part taken in the settlement, foundation, and up-building
of these United States by the Irish race has never received
proper recognition from historians, and inspired by love for the
republic, a pride in our blood and forefathers, and a desire for historic
truth, this society has met and organized.</p>

<p class='c007'>Its mission is to give a plain recital of facts, to correct errors, to
supply omissions, to allay passions, to shame prejudice, and to labor
for right and truth.</p>

<p class='c007'>While we, as loyal citizens of this republic, are earnestly interested
in all the various phases of its history, we feel that we should
be false to its honor and greatness and recreant to our own blood
if we did not make a serious effort to leave to those generations
which will follow us a clearer and better knowledge of the important
work done by men and women of the Irish race on this continent.
People of this race—men and women born on Irish
soil—have been here from the first, prompted in their flight by the
motives common to all immigration, dissatisfaction with the old order
of things, and the resolve to obtain a freer and better life in the new
land under new conditions.</p>

<p class='c007'>And so we have come together—natives of Ireland, American
sons of Irish immigrants, and descendants of immigrants even unto
the seventh, eighth, and ninth American generations—to duly set
forth and perpetuate a knowledge of these things.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the days to come, that lie in the womb of the future, when all
the various elements that have gone and are going to make the republic
great, are united in the American,—the man who in his person
will represent the bravest elements of all the old races of earth,—we
desire that the deeds and accomplishments of our element
shall be written in the book of the new race, telling what we did and
no more; giving us our rightful place by the side of the others.</p>

<p class='c007'>To accomplish this is the purpose of this organization; it is a work
worthy of the sympathy and aid of every American who can rise above
the environment of to-day and look into the broad future. Fidelity,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>truth, honor, are the watchwords of such a purpose, and under their
noble influence should our work be done.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><em>Article I.—Name.</em></h3>

<p class='c011'>This organization shall be known as the <span class='sc'>American-Irish Historical
Society</span>.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><em>Article II.—Objects and Purposes.</em></h3>

<p class='c011'>The objects and purposes of this society are:</p>

<p class='c007'>(1) The study of American history generally.</p>

<p class='c007'>(2) To investigate, specially, the immigration of the people of Ireland
to this country, determine its numbers, examine the sources,
learn the places of its settlement; and estimate its influence on contemporary
events in war, legislation, religion, education, and other
departments of human activity.</p>

<p class='c007'>(3) To examine records of every character, wherever found, calculated
to throw light on the work of the Irish element in this broad
land.</p>

<p class='c007'>(4) To endeavor to correct erroneous, distorted, and false views of
history, where they are known, and to substitute therefor the truth
of history, based on documentary evidence and the best and most
reasonable tradition, in relation to the Irish race in America.</p>

<p class='c007'>(5) To encourage and assist the formation of local societies in
American cities and towns for the work of the parent society.</p>

<p class='c007'>(6) To promote and foster an honorable and national spirit of
patriotism, which will know no lines of division, which will be based
upon loyalty to the laws, institutions, and spirit of the republic to
whose up-building the Irish element has unselfishly contributed in blood
and treasure, a patriotism whose simple watchwords will be true Americanism
and human freedom, and which has no concern for any man’s
race, color, or creed, measuring him only by his conduct, effort, and
achievement.</p>

<p class='c007'>(7) To promote by union in a common high purpose a sincere
fraternity, a greater emulation in well-doing, a closer confidence and
mutual respect among the various elements of the Irish race in America,
that, by putting behind them the asperities of the past, they may
unite in a common brotherhood with their fellow-citizens for the
honor of the race and the glory of the republic.</p>

<p class='c007'>(8) To place the result of its historical investigations and researches
in acceptable literary form; to print, publish, and distribute
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>its documents to libraries, institutions of learning, and among its members,
in order that the widest dissemination of historical truth may
be obtained and placed within the reach of historians and other
writers and readers.</p>

<p class='c007'>(9) To sift and discriminate every paper, sketch, document,
bearing on the society’s line of work, before the same is accepted and
given official sanction, in order that its publication may be a guarantee
of historical accuracy; to do its work without passion or prejudice,
to view accomplished facts in the true scientific historical spirit,
and, having reached the truth, to give it to the world.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><em>Article III.—Membership.</em></h3>

<p class='c011'>Any person, of good moral character, who is interested in the special

<p class='c000'>After the reception and introduction of those present, dinner

guest Paul B. Du Chaillu, the noted explorer, author of <cite>The
Viking Age</cite>, <cite>The Land of the Midnight Sun</cite>, and numerous
other works.</p>

<p class='c000'>Upon the conclusion of the dinner, Mr. Gargan arose and
said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“In the name of the committee who have issued the call for the
organization of an American Historical Society, whose special line of
research shall be the history of the Irish element in the composition
of the American people, I congratulate you on the success of this
initial movement and bid you a cordial welcome to this meeting.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But little has yet been done to show how much the sons of Ireland
and their descendants have contributed to the settlement, to
the civilization and reclamation of this country, as also to its liberation
from oppression.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In our proposed work we will discard the legendary and the
mythical. We recognize that we are living in a scientific age at
the end of the nineteenth century, the age of the microscope and
the X-ray, and we ask for the acceptance of no historical data that
will not bear the modern search-light and that is not sufficiently
proven.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We claim that due credit has not been given to the Irish contributions.
That through prejudice or through gross ignorance there
has grown up a myth about the Scotch-Irish. Of all the myths that
have crept into history this is the most mythical. Why any man
should be ashamed of his honorable Irish ancestry surpasses my
comprehension and subjects the man who attempts to deny it to the
scorn and contempt of all honest and intelligent men.</p>

    <div>EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>“Descendants of Irishmen may well feel proud of the honorable
part which the Irish race has borne in the settlement and development
of the country. As early as 1649, Cromwell, by his cruel policy,
transported 45,000 of them beyond the seas. A large number came
to Barbadoes. Many of them afterwards came to the continent of
North America.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The revolution of 1688 in England, and the acts of British Parliament
to discourage manufactures in Ireland, drove 100,000 operatives
out of Ireland, and a writer of that time says multitudes of them went
to America.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In 1729 a writer stated that 3000 males left Ulster yearly for the
American colonies. And the arrivals at the port of Philadelphia for
1729 are set down as: English and Welsh, 267; Scotch, 43; German,
343; Irish, 5655, or a proportion of ten Irish immigrants to one from
all other European nations. This constant influx continued, though
not in so great proportion. So we see what an important factor they
were in the settlement of the colonies.</p>

<p class='c007'>“James Logan, of Lurgan, Ire., came over with William Penn, and
complaint was made against him that public Mass was permitted in
the colony.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The name of Logan has through all our history been honorably
identified with every step of our progress. In 1729 several families
came from Longford, Ire., who were landed at Cape Cod, but made
their way to New York. Among them was Charles Clinton, whose
three children became historical men in the annals of New York.
The colony of Maryland was largely settled from Ireland; the
Carrolls, whose names are indissolubly associated with American
history, coming to the colony in 1689.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In 1710 we find in Virginia along the Blue Ridge, in what are
now the counties of Patrick and Rockbridge, the McDowells, Breckenridges,
McDuffies, McGruders, and others, and the two rivers
Mayo, and the towns called McGaheysville, Healysville, Kennedysville,
McFarland, Lynchburg, and Kinsdale,—all names that tell us
plainly what was the origin of the settlers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In 1737 an Irish settlement was established on the Santee
River in South Carolina, and the historian of that time says none
has furnished so many settlers to this province as Ireland.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In 1746 Daniel Boone commenced the settlement of Kentucky,
and had with him Hugh McGrady, also Harland and McBride.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>“In the Massachusetts Bay Colonies, prejudices against natives
of Ireland existed almost from the settlement of the colony. There
were restrictions as to land, and in 1720 the General Court warned
settlers from Ireland to leave the colony within seven months.</p>

<p class='c007'>“As you all know, in 1737 the Charitable Irish Society was founded
here in Boston by twenty-six natives of Ireland, Robert Duncan
heading the list. William Hall was the first president, and in that
list of names are the founders of many distinguished Boston families,
some of whom, I am sorry to say, are not inclined to own their origin,
or choose rather to call themselves Scotch-Irish, an appellation which
their ancestors would have despised. We find at Concord the burial
place of Hugh Cargill, born in Ballyshannon, who came to this
country, in 1744, a poor emigrant, acquiring no mean estate, leaving
as a legacy the Stratton farm to the town of Concord to be used for
the poor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There also came to Massachusetts the Limerick schoolmaster,
John O’Sullivan, a name illustrious in our country’s annals. One of
his sons was General Sullivan, of Revolutionary fame. One of his
lineal descendants, Mr. Russell Sullivan, the well-known author, is
one of the signers of our roll. There were Higginses and Reillys at
Plymouth and along the shores of Cape Cod.</p>

<p class='c007'>“One of the Indian transfers of land was to one of the Reillys.</p>

<p class='c007'>“One of the most distinguished Irishmen who came to New
England was George Berkely, a native of Kilkenny. Born near
Thomaston, he came here to found a college for the civilization of
the Indians. He is best remembered by his poems. Those of you
who have visited the national capitol at Washington will see in fresco
on the walls at the foot of the stairway portrayed by the brush of the
artist in almost speaking pictures the story of the settlement and
civilization of the United States, and you will see inscribed the lines
which gave the artist inspiration, written by George Berkely:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Westward the course of empire takes its way;</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The four first acts already past,</div>
      <div class='line'>A fifth shall close the drama with the day:</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Time’s noblest offspring is the last.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Yet we should not be vainglorious. We are but representatives
of many nations who from the earliest settlement of the country have
helped to plant here free institutions, but we are not intruders, nor
are we here by the tolerance of any party. We live here under
the constitution and laws of the country, and are vitally interested in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>its well-being and future prosperity. We, of this generation, decline
to accept that series of lies which English historians and their imitators
have agreed upon as truthful history of what the Irish have
done in this country or any other country.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We propose to investigate facts and ask for their impartial
consideration.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The object of this association is to call to mind those noble types
of men and women that the Irish race have sent here, that we may
receive credit for our fair share in the development and maintenance
of a government founded upon manhood.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hon. John C. Linehan spoke briefly, saying: “I think there is not
a prouder title than that of American citizen. I am proud of it. I
glory in it. But as I believe that a man who cannot love his mother
cannot love his wife, a man who is false to the land of his birth can
never be true to the land of his adoption. New Hampshire presents
a rich field for the society’s research.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Our first governor was an Irishman. Darby Field, an Irish
soldier, discovered the White Mountains, and there was not a battle
of the French and Indian wars in which Irish blood was not spilt
just as freely as in the battles of the Civil War.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If we do our work, the American people, of whatever birth, will
put the present Scotch-Irish myth where it belongs.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Joseph Smith, secretary of the Lowell Police Board, urged work on
the part of every member. “We cannot deal in hurrah business,”
he said. “We must produce the cold documents and facts that no
one can dispute, and eliminate from history its imaginary and fictitious
bluffs. All must work in investigation in their own towns and
vicinity. We must organize in every town and city, and every year
have a meeting of this parent society to garner and publish our discovered
and compiled facts. This cold documentary evidence cannot
be disputed, and falsehood and fiction will cease.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Osborne Howes, the seventh in line from an Irish settler of Cape
Cod, said it was not so much a matter of self-laudation, but to create
a spirit in the people. He believed in the necessity of a race living
up to its ideal, and the higher the ideal could be placed the better
for all of the race; they will have something to look forward to,
something to eliminate.</p>

<p class='c007'>Paul Du Chaillu heartily endorsed the purpose as a most laudable
one. “But don’t be self-laudable,” he advised, “you want the facts,
the truth; unearth the truth for truth’s sake; present it to the world
and don’t be afraid of opposition. Defy it.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>Charles A. De Courcey, of Lawrence, spoke of the feeling and
experience and slurs cast upon every school child of Irish parentage
in the past, and to some extent to-day. “We were foreign. We did
not feel at home. But we began to know. We began to feel at home.
We learned of our race’s participation in the up-building of the
nation. We will prove our part in America’s history; then the
children as Americans can feel as Americans.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Rev. John J. McCoy, in an able speech, declared: “The records
are so honorable that, although it is rather late to make the start, we
all ought to find very pleasant work in assisting to look them up.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Editor George H. Moses, of the <cite>Concord Monitor</cite>, Senator Chandler’s
paper, ex-Mayor Hugh J. Carroll, of Pawtucket, and Hon. P. J.
Flatley, of Boston, made speeches, urging the conduct of the research
with true historic spirit.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Flatley, in his impromptu speech, handled the “Scotch-Irish”
myth without gloves.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following officers were elected:</p>

<p class='c000'>Rear-Admiral Richard Worsam Meade, U. S. Navy (retired),
President-General; Thomas Hamilton Murray, Pawtucket, R. I.,

<p class='c000'>The vice-presidents are: Massachusetts, Osborne Howes,

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>The position of historiographer has been left vacant until a
subsequent meeting of the executive body.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Joseph Smith, of Lowell, in behalf of the committee
appointed to prepare a constitution and by-laws, submitted a
report, and the same met with the unanimous approval of the
gathering. The preamble is as follows:</p>

<p class='c000'>Believing that the part taken in the settlement, foundation,
and up-building of these United States by the Irish race has
never received proper recognition from historians, and inspired
by love for the republic, a pride in our blood and forefathers,
and a desire for historic truth, this society has met and
organized.</p>

<p class='c000'>Its mission is to give a plain recital of facts, to correct errors,
to supply omissions, to allay passions, to shame prejudice, and
to labor for right and truth.</p>

<p class='c000'>While we, as loyal citizens of this republic, are earnestly
interested in all the various phases of its history, we feel that
we should be false to its honor and greatness, and recreant to
our own blood, if we did not make a serious effort to leave to
those generations which follow us a clearer and better knowledge
of the important work done by men and women of the
Irish race on this continent. People of this race—men and
women born on Irish soil—have been here from the first,
prompted in their flight by the motives common to all immigration,—dissatisfaction
with the old order of things and the
resolve to obtain a freer and better life in the new land under
new conditions.</p>

<p class='c000'>And so we have come together—natives of Ireland, American
sons of Irish immigrants, and descendants of immigrants
even unto the seventh, eighth, and ninth American generations—duly
to set forth and perpetuate a knowledge of these
things.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the days to come, that lie in the womb of the future, when
all the various elements that have gone and are going to make
the republic great are united in the American,—the man who
in his person will represent the bravest elements of all the old
races of earth,—we desire that the deeds and accomplishments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>of our element shall be written in the book of the new race,
telling what we did, and no more; giving us our rightful place
by the side of others.</p>

<p class='c000'>To accomplish this is the purpose of this organization; it is
a work worthy of the sympathy and aid of every American who
can rise above the environment of to-day and look into the
broad future. Fidelity, truth, honor are the watchwords of
such a purpose, and under their noble influence should our work
be done.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thomas Hamilton Murray, secretary of the meeting, was
then introduced and stated that letters expressive of interest
in the organization, acknowledging an invitation or giving an
expression of opinion, had been received from a large number
of people. The list of writers included the following:</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Dear Mr. Roche</span>:—Your note of November 26 with its enclosure
has only just reached me here. In reply I would say that you are at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>liberty to enroll my name as you desire. My ancestor, Robert
Meade, who died in this city in August, 1754, was an Irish gentleman,
who, having to choose between his conscience and his native land,
chose to leave his native land for the sake of conscience and to
cast in his lot with the people of the New World. He was one of the
“Wild Geese.” His son, George Meade, born in this city, Feb. 27,
1741, died here in 1808. His life has been written for the volumes
of the American Catholic Historical Society of this city. He was a
patriot of the finest type, and his name is on the Roll of Honor in
Independence Hall in this city.</p>

<p class='c007'>Since then four generations have borne the name of Richard Worsam
Meade, and all, I believe, with honor. My father’s younger
brother, George Gordon Meade, is sufficiently well known to the
country in connection with Gettysburg. In the life of George Meade,
alluded to above, you will see what <em>I</em> say about “Irishmen.”</p>

<p class='c007'>My father’s mother was Margaret Butler, of this city, and she also
traced her ancestry to a famous strain of Norman-Irish blood.</p>

<p class='c007'>No, sir! None of the Meades or Butlers are ashamed of their
Irish lineage! Rather the contrary do we rejoice that our forefathers
came from the Emerald Isle, the land of dauntless men and
pure women, and that they represented the best blood of the Island.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have just read the letter which you kindly sent me, giving in
outline the scope and purpose of the proposed Historical Society
and bearing the names of many distinguished citizens. I am very
much pleased with the project and gratified to see that so many eminent
gentlemen have become interested in the movement, and regret
that official duties will prevent my attendance at the initial meeting.
That the undertaking is needful and timely, the letter well demonstrates,
and the broad foundation indicated will undoubtedly attract
the moral and material support of all American citizens who want
nothing but the truth recorded and preserved in the archives of history.
May success attend the noble work of vindicating the worth
and memory of a superior race!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your proposal to found a society devoted to the preservation of
records of the services of Irishmen in the colonization and subsequent
history of America meets my approval. Although the biographies
of some of the early pioneers of that race have been carefully
and fully treated, owing to the devotion of their descendants to their
memory, only a very small part has ever been written of the history
of the stock as a whole, and some of their achievements have, through
prejudice, been ascribed to another people. Many Protestants of
Irish derivation are claiming a Scotch lineage for their immigrant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>ancestor, which he would have repudiated; and yet they are often
innocent of intent to mislead; so thoroughly in certain quarters has
the theory been nursed, that Protestant Irishmen, particularly those
from the northern province, are invariably descended from the Scotch
blood. As an American in the ninth American generation, who, by
the services of three great grandfathers in the armies of the Revolution,
holds membership in both the ‘Sons of the Revolution’ and
‘Sons of the American Revolution,’ and as a member of the ‘Essex
Institute’ and ‘Roxbury Military Historical Society,’ both devoted
to historical research, I naturally desire that all branches of our
country’s history should receive the attention they deserve. That
a race so prolific, so inwrought with the old stock of the land, so productive
of men of mark and merit, should till now remain without a
representative society to defend its record and its heroes, is most surprising.
That it is soon to have such we may rest assured from the
names of its sponsors, who are a guaranty of success.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>My Dear Sir</span>:—I am in full accord with a movement toward the
establishment of an American Historical Society, according to the
lines projected by you. The object is most praiseworthy, and
the results will be most valuable. It is a shame for us that so much
valuable matter has been lost because of no medium of salvation.
Let us save what we can, and gather together the records of our race
in the fields of literature, patriotism, business, and professional life.
The story has not been fully written; but when this has been done, it
will be found that our people have done their share in the work of
civilization, liberty, and letters in the great Republic, for the preservation
of which so many generously gave their lives.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Dear Sir</span>:—I am too much occupied with my professional
engagements to be able to get away from home at this season, and I
will therefore not be able to attend the meeting for organizing the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>society on January 20. But I am in close sympathy with the movement,
and believe that there exists a large and promising field for an
Irish Historical Society in this country. This opinion is based on
the fact that during a long life I have devoted the greater part of my
leisure time to the study of American history. Until recently I
possessed probably the largest library and the largest collection of
autographic documents bearing on American history ever held by one
individual. From my knowledge thus gained, I am firmly of the
conviction that the Irish, by birth or descent, have contributed during
the past two hundred years, and from every station in life, more in
number, more brain work and muscle for the development of the
country at large than has been furnished by every other nationality
of the world combined.</p>

<p class='c007'>With some experience in getting up such an undertaking, I will
take the liberty of making a suggestion: The success of the proposed
society will rest entirely, I believe, on one feature—putting it in the
hands of young men, who must be put forward with the responsibility
to do the work. It is but proper that the older men should make
the first move, give it their support and contribute hereafter so far
as they may be able to do; but unless the young men become interested
in the undertaking, and sufficiently to be willing to do the
work, it will prove a failure.</p>

States, born in foreign countries or descended from persons born
outside of this country, that, while esteeming the institutions of this
land and having a patriotic interest in its welfare, they should at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>same time retain warm affection for the mother country and a strong
interest in the doings of its sons. Because such persons love a new
country, there is no reason why they should cease to love the old
country. They would show a lack of right feeling were they to do
so. I heartily favor the formation of societies by studious people
interested in the history of different elements of our population, and
should think that Americans of Irish origin would find the study of
the history of the Irish in this country especially interesting and
profitable. They would find, I should think, a rich return in striving
to bring to light incidents in their history by forming a society with
this purpose in view.”</p>

associations do good. We are a new people, derived from many race
strains, and different from any one of them, and it is a good thing to
have brought before us our diversity in race origin. Like most New
Yorkers, whose American ancestry goes back for more than two centuries,
I have an ancestral right to belong to several societies of this
kind, and I enjoy equally attending the dinners of the Hollander, the
Huguenot, the Scotchman, and the Irishman. It seems to me the
one lesson to be remembered always by those who belong to these
associations is that in time their descendants will most surely have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>the right to belong to many other similar associations; for in time the
different strains of blood will all be blended together, English and
Irish, German and French. When that time comes, and before it,
the chief thing for all of us to keep in mind is that we must be good
Americans, purely as such, no matter what be our creed or our
ancestry in Europe.</p>

as I am sure they will, they are collected and preserved in the true
historic spirit, without concealing or slurring over, or exaggerating
anything, they will be of great value. Let no Irishman be ashamed
of his origin or the humble condition from which so many of his
countrymen came. The Irish race has done a great service to
America. They made a splendid contribution toward saving our
national life during the Rebellion. The story of their generosity and
affection for the kindred they left behind is one of the most touching
and stirring in history. But they have had, have now, and will continue
to have for a good while to come, grave faults. To say this is
only to say that they are human. Do not be afraid to record their
faults as well as their virtues, and the faithful portraiture will be one
well deserving a place in our nation’s gallery.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Dear Sir</span>:—My age and consequent infirmities prevent me from
attending too many night meetings in a month. I have promised to
be present on the 16th at the annual dinner of the Alumni of the
University of Pennsylvania, and on the 25th to attend the Burns
celebration of the Newark Caledonian Club. This is about as much
as I can attend to without endangering my health. I regret, however,
my enforced absence, because I have a cordial sympathy with
the proposed movement. As a descendant on my father’s side
through over two centuries of American ancestors from Norman-Irish
stock, and more immediately on my mother’s side from the Gaelic, I
naturally take an interest in all that concerns the honor and reputation
of my lineage. I therefore beg of you to place my name on the
list of original members when you organize.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have a further interest in the matter as a native American desiring
that our federal and state historical records should be accurate
and complete. Writers covering the part played by Irishmen in this
country’s history generally confine themselves to services rendered
during a revolutionary and post-revolutionary wars; and these the
enemies of Ireland constantly depreciate, and the friends of Ireland
sometimes exaggerate. Both sides lose sight of the fact that very
much is due to Irish efforts in the colonization of the country and in
its civil and social development. The society proposed will be able
to show how much the Quaker Irish in Philadelphia and its vicinity,
the Catholic Irish in Maryland, and bodies and individuals of them
elsewhere on the seaboard did to develop our civilization and promote
our progress. The society will have a rich and poorly worked mine
of historical wealth in another quarter. The Appalachian and Alleghanian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>ranges and their immediate valleys found large numbers of
Irish settlers among the pioneers, and from Londonderry in New
Hampshire to Murphy and Coleraine in Georgia, there extends a long
line of settlements where many customs, terms, phrases, and modes
of thought and action attest the country of the founders. “The dark
and bloody ground” of Kentucky has among its residents so many
with Hibernian names, though the sept mark of O’ has been dropped
in many cases, the Macs being more adherent, that in calling off the
assessment rolls in some quarters it would seem to the hearer as
though he had dropped in upon the meeting of some Irish society.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>My Dear Sir</span>:—Your letter of the 18th inst., enclosing a cutting
relating to the proposed new historical society, arrived during my
absence from the city. As regards the desirability of thorough
investigation into the early history of the Irish element of our American
population, there can be no question whatever. The confusion
that has arisen regarding the several constituents of the Irish immigration—as
witnessed, for example, in the general use of the word
Scotch-Irish, applied indifferently to persons of pure English, pure
Scotch, and pure Irish blood—shows abundantly the need of careful
dispassionate research; and all should rejoice to see the work undertaken
in the most effective way.</p>

<p class='c007'>The question whether such an investigation should be begun and
carried on through existing historical societies and agencies, or
through the organization of a new society specifically for this object,
is one regarding which my opinion would be of little value. My life
has not been mainly devoted to historical investigation; and, even
where I have worked by myself in this field, I have, I fear, been a
very poor member of the several historical societies to which I
belong.</p>

I am in hearty accord with the purpose of your organization. The
Irish race owe it to themselves and their successors to leave a united
history of an undivided people in America. One of the noblest
characteristics of the Irishman is that he is religious, and has enough
of religion to be willing to fight for it. But God forbid that this
should in any way hinder in telling the united story of our people.
The Irish Catholic and the Irish Presbyterian have more than once
stood together for liberal government in Ireland. And the Irish
Presbyterian and Irish Catholic stood together here when Washington
was leading the people from under the yoke of oppressive taxation
without representation. The Irish-American has a place and a
name in this glorious country of ours, and as we fought for our freedom
and then for the Union we will live—and, if need be, fight side
by side to maintain it.</p>

been unanimously chosen for the office of President-General of the
American-Irish Historical Society, found me confined to my bed,
where I have been since the 8th, with a severe attack of grippe.
The hardships of a long naval career are beginning now to revenge
themselves on me, and I have to take great care of my health.</p>

<p class='c007'>I am, of course, deeply sensible of the honor your society confers
upon me and shall accept the office with pleasure if you think the
duties will not try me physically beyond my strength. I am vigorous

spent a great part of my naval life in the tropics, and I cannot travel
about in winter without serious risk to my health.</p>

<p class='c007'>I am ready to work in the ranks for the good of the new society

<p class='c000'>Mr. Murray, in his paper on “The Irish Bacons,” noted that
the family has reflected honor on both Dedham and Needham,
as it has on other towns where representatives of it have resided.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hon. John C. Linehan read the following paper:</p>

<h3 class='c010'><span class='sc'>John Sullivan and the Capture of the Powder at Newcastle.</span></h3>

<p class='c011'>The province of New Hampshire was among the first to resist the
unjust exactions of the British government, and, on the authority of
one of the Royal Councillors, her sons were the very first to commit
an overt act against it. From the time of its early settlement, under
the proprietorship of Capt. John Mason, her sturdy colonists were
bound to appropriate to their own use the first fruits of their labors,
and, regardless of act of parliament or magisterial edict, they were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>able to accomplish their purpose. Owing to the civil dissensions in
England between 1640 and 1700, the little band of adventurers who
had established themselves at “Old Strawberry Bank,” as well as
their descendants who came after them, were practically, so far as
the home government was concerned, left to their own resources, and
obliged to defend themselves as best they could against the French
and Indians, who were ever on the alert to harass and annoy them.
The establishment of William of Orange on the English throne, and
the complete subjugation of those who supported the unfortunate
James, changed matters, however, and gave the new ruler an opportunity
to bestow a little of his paternal care on the colonists who had
so long prospered greatly without it.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of his very first acts was to appoint, as governor of New
York, the Earl of Bellmont, who was a native of Ireland, and a son
of Sir Charles Coote, who earned an Irish estate fighting for
Cromwell.</p>

<p class='c007'>Under his administration the heirs of Captain Mason, fortified by
a proclamation from the king and parliament, endeavored to establish
their ownership to the property left them in New Hampshire,
and, although not authorized by the act mentioned to collect arrearages
of rent from the descendants of the original settlers, little progress
was made in the collection of any. The men, and the children
of the men who had for half a century contested every inch of New
Hampshire soil with the elements, the wild beasts, the Indians, and
their white allies from Quebec, did not propose to pay tribute to the
grandchildren of the man whose name was but a tradition. The result
was the creation of a period in the records of New Hampshire,
whose history reads strangely like a page from Ireland’s annals describing
landlord rule.</p>

<p class='c007'>For in all parts of the province, and among all classes of people,
the most determined efforts were made to prevent the impositions of
the new proprietors. The sheriff and his officers, while engaged
in the performance of their duties, were often confronted with the axe
and the musket, and when opportunity offered, the women took a
hand and tested the efficacy of hot water. The sacred person of the
governor even was not exempt from insult and assault, for on at
least one occasion, while endeavoring to shield Captain Mason, the
grandson of the original proprietor, from one of his irate tenants, he
was thrown into the fireplace on the burning coals, sat upon, three
of his ribs broken, two teeth knocked out, and his body severely
burned.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>William Vaughan, one of the Royal Councillors, and among the
most influential men in the colony, for an assault upon one of the
officers of the king, was arrested, and for several years kept in confinement.</p>

<p class='c007'>The records of the province during this period, as printed in the
state papers, make very interesting reading. The little rock-ribbed
province was the northern picket line of New England, and in consequence
her sons were equally expert with the musket, the axe, and
the spade.</p>

<p class='c007'>That these traits had been transmitted to their descendants is
very clear, for the construction of the grapevine bridge across the
Chickahominy in 1862, by the boys of the 5th New Hampshire, as
well as the record made by the same regiment during the Civil War,
is the evidence; the axe, the spade, and the rifle figuring in both,
as they had in the hands of their ancestors at Bunker Hill and Bennington
nearly a century before. But the demands of Captain
Mason were not the only grievances. The government was bound
to suppress any industry in the colonies which would in any way
interfere with those already in operation at home. An elaborate
project had been already planned by the Earl of Bellmont, for the
production of tar and pitch in New Hampshire.</p>

<p class='c007'>The home government was paying Denmark one hundred thousand
pounds annually for these two articles. Both could, with a little
perseverance and care, be produced on this side of the water, and
be paid for, not in cash, but in the products of the English mills and
shops, and in this manner saving the money and finding a new market
for goods.</p>

<p class='c007'>To this end, pine trees were selected and stripped, but before the
scheme had matured, and the first step taken, the wicked New Hampshire
men set fire to the trees, and this, with the Indian troubles,
which were endless, put an end to the tar and pitch arrangement.
This was not all they did, however. The governor claimed that not
only did these lawless men of “Old Strawberry Bank” cut down the
king’s timber which had been reserved for the Royal Navy, but that
they had sawn it up into deals, and actually sold it to the enemies of
the government, in the French and Spanish West Indies; and that no
less a person than the Lieutenant-Governor of New Hampshire was
engaged in the business, and not only engaged in it, but had boasted
of his profits, and thus incited others to go and do likewise. He
next tried to introduce the cultivation of flax, but this was a failure,
labor costing three times here what it would in Ireland. This paternal
care of the government continued under William’s successors.
In 1749 an act of parliament, while encouraging the production of
pig and bar iron, absolutely forbade its manufacture, and to carry
its terms into effect, proclamation was made by the provincial sheriffs,
and an inquiry as to the number of mills and forges in the province
was instituted by the governor, to the end that steps might be
taken to have them discontinued. With such an experience as this
extending over three-quarters of a century, the people of New Hampshire
were not only in sympathy with their fellow-countrymen in the
other colonies, but stood ready as well to coöperate in any movement
having for its object the welfare of the people as against the
government.</p>

    <div>EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>At a meeting held in Portsmouth on Dec. 16, 1773, one of the
resolutions adopted was, “That every virtuous and public-spirited
freeman ought to oppose, to the utmost of his ability, every attack of
the ministry to enslave the Americans.” Five months later, on May
19, 1774, a committee of the town of Portsmouth sent their sympathies
to the people of Boston on the closing of their port, and for
their fellow-townsmen, promised to exert themselves to carry into
effect any plan which might be concerted by the colonies for the
general relief, and that the interests of the people of Boston would
be considered as their own.</p>

<p class='c007'>From this time to the departure of the royal governor forever,
it was a game of battledoor and shuttlecock between his excellency
and the general assembly; the latter energetic and firm; the former
diplomatic, but cautious and watchful, and ever on the alert to subserve
the interest of the home government.</p>

<p class='c007'>To this end he refused at first to adjourn the assembly in May,
1774, but finally acceded to the request of the members, and an adjournment
was made to June 12 of the same year. Meantime the
excitement increased; events at home and abroad intensifying the
feeling against the government.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the adjourned meeting in May, the House of Representatives,
in common with the assemblies of the other colonies, had appointed
a committee of correspondence. This Governor Wentworth tried to
prevent, and when he dissolved the assembly he was fain to believe
the committee of correspondence would disappear with it.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this he was disappointed, for its very first act after the dissolution
of the assembly was to issue a summons to the representatives,
who again met in their own chamber. The governor, attended by
the sheriff of the county, entered, and in accordance with custom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>they rose when he presented himself. He addressed them, declaring
the meeting illegal, and directed the sheriff to make proclamation
accordingly, ordering all to disperse. He then retired, but they
resumed their seats.</p>

<p class='c007'>On further consideration they adjourned to another house, where
it was resolved to hold a convention at Exeter, which should choose
delegates to the General Congress to meet in Philadelphia, and to that
end, letters were sent to each town and parish in the colony, inviting
the people therein to send deputies to the Provincial Congress. The
last business transacted by the representatives was to recommend
a day of fasting and prayer to be observed by the people of the
province. According to Belknap, this was observed with religious
solemnity. A request was made at the same time for funds to defray
the expenses of the delegates to the Continental Congress, and
this was promptly responded to.</p>

<p class='c007'>The convention called at Exeter assembled on July 21, 1774, and
is now known in history as the “First Provincial Congress” of New
Hampshire. There were eighty-five members present, with the
speaker of the assembly, Hon. John Wentworth, a relative of the
governor in the chair.</p>

<p class='c007'>This distinguished body, composed of the best men in the province,
many of whom had seen service in the French and Indian wars, and
who can justly be styled the founders of the state, chose for their
first representatives to the Continental Congress Maj. John Sullivan
and Col. Nathaniel Folsom; and for the first time in the
history of his native state does the name of John Sullivan officially
make its appearance in its legislative records. It is evident to any one
who has read closely the history of the stirring events of the period
that some master hand was at work directing all the movements,
civil and military, occurring at the time; and that this was the hand
of John Sullivan later events prove clearly. The son of an Irish exile,
and the grandson of one of the ill-fated defenders of Limerick, he
was born in Somersworth, N. H., at a point opposite Berwick, Me.,
on February 18, 1740.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was educated by his father, who had himself enjoyed the benefits
of a liberal and thorough training before he settled in America,
and who, through a long life, extending to his one hundred and fifth
year, was diligently employed in the education of youth. After a
voyage to the West Indies he became a member of the family of
Hon. Isaac Livermore, a lawyer of Portsmouth having an extensive
practice, and under his instruction prepared himself for his profession.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>He early exhibited ability of a high order, gained the respect and
encouragement of his instructor, and soon acquired a distinguished
position at the bar of New Hampshire. Just before reaching his
majority he located in the town of Durham, purchased a handsome
residence, which is still in existence, and in which he lived up to the
time of his death. Such was his professional success, that he married
at the age of twenty, and for ten years later he was constantly
employed in the most lucrative causes, thereby incurring the resentment
of sundry persons in Durham and elsewhere, who petitioned
the executive council in 1766, complaining of him for evil practices
as attorney-at-law. This trouble, whatever its nature may have been,
existed even to the end of his days, and was doubtless at the bottom
of the scheme to injure his reputation years after his death; for to
this day there are some who would rob him of the credit given him
in the state records for planning the capture of the powder at Newcastle
and leading the party that effected it.</p>

<p class='c007'>In eloquence as an advocate he won a place in the front rank, and
earned the reputation of being a sound lawyer and a judicious
counsellor. This character was not confined to his native state, for
in addition to the friendship of men like the Wentworths and Langdons
in New Hampshire, he had secured the esteem and respect of
Lowell, Adams, Otis, and other well-known legal lights in Massachusetts.
Although attached to his profession, he found time to devote
to agriculture and manufactures, being one of the early promoters of
the latter, establishing cloth and fulling mills in Durham, and succeeding
so well that on the authority of John Adams he was worth
ten thousand pounds before the Revolution broke out. From his
father and mother he inherited a robust constitution, and was blessed
with an active, lively disposition. He had a natural taste for military
life, but except an occasional bout with the Indians, generally on
the defensive, he had, before the Revolutionary War, no actual experience
in warfare; but all around him were the veterans of the Indian
and French wars, whose descriptions of the campaigns of Louisburg
and Quebec aroused all the martial spirit in his fiery nature.</p>

<p class='c007'>To his historical studies, especially those relating to military movements,
he was greatly devoted; and read them to such good purpose
that he was able accurately to describe nearly all of the great battles
of the world. It was natural, therefore, for him to seek the exercise
of arms early; so at the age of thirty-one he held the commission of
major in the Colonial militia, and spared no pains to make himself
familiar with the duties connected with the position. From the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>rumble of discontent, down to the actual outbreak of hostilities, he
was one of the most active men engaged in the cause of liberty.
His nature and his abhorrence of oppression, two traits transmitted
by generations of heroic ancestors, marked his career from the beginning,
and his extended influence and popularity marked him early as
a leader in the coming contest. With a full realization of what was
before him he organized a company numbering eighty-three men in
Durham, and associated with him was the gallant young Scammell,
who was then a law student in his office. With a knowledge of
these facts it is not too much to say, especially when comparing
them with the events occurring afterwards, that the “hidden hand”
which directed the movements of the patriots in New Hampshire,
down to the convening of the First Provincial Congress in July, 1774,
was that of the grandson of the Limerick soldier, who, in little less
than a century from the broken treaty, was paying with interest the
debt due the government which had driven his father to the wilds of
America. He was chosen by the First Provincial Congress to represent
his province in the Continental Congress, being the first person
to represent New Hampshire in that body. Two instances will be
sufficient to show his energy and usefulness in that assemblage.
On qualifying, he was at once placed on two of the most important
committees, of one of which, that upon the grievances of the people,
he was chairman.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The committee of violation of rights,” says John Adams in his
diary, “reported a set of articles which were drawn by John Sullivan,
of New Hampshire; and these two declarations, the one of rights
and the other of violations, which are printed in the journals of Congress
for 1774, were two years afterwards recapitulated in the
Declaration of Independence on the 4th of July, 1776.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“New Hampshire has perhaps not remembered that the bold hand
and the legal training of John Sullivan are in the immortal Declaration
of Independence.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On the adjournment of Congress, Sullivan returned to New
Hampshire. During his absence the agitation had increased;
nearly every town had its committee of safety, and many persons
of note, suspected of a leaning towards the government, placed
under arrest and kept in confinement, or sent out of the state,
unless they took the test oath prescribed by the Assembly. Steps
were also taken to prevent the sending of carpenters and other mechanics
to Boston to build barracks for the royal troops, as men
could not be secured there for that purpose. In one instance a man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>suspected of procuring workmen for General Gage, was waited on,
and the charge being proven, he was obliged to go on his knees, as
nothing less would be satisfactory, and make the following confession
and promise:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Before this company I confess I have been aiding and assisting
in sending men to Boston to build barracks for the soldiers to live in,
at which you have reason to be justly offended, which I am sorry
for and humbly ask your forgiveness. And I do affirm that for the
future I never will be aiding or assisting in any wise whatever, in act
or deed contrary to the constitution of the country, as witness my
hand.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The military stores in Fort William and Mary at Newcastle were a
constant source of anxiety to the governor, but he felt confident that
no lawless act would be committed by the people without provocation,
and as he was cautious in his course, no pretext could be found
in that direction, but the inevitable was to happen. A report was
circulated that General Gage was to send a body of troops to secure
the ammunition.</p>

<p class='c007'>The arrival of Paul Revere from Boston gave color to the rumor,
and on the day following, armed men from the surrounding towns
assembled in Portsmouth, and after effecting an organization and
choosing their leaders, marched in broad daylight, to the number
of four hundred, for Newcastle. On arriving at the fort the commander
bade them to enter at their peril. No heed being paid to his
words, one volley was fired from the three-pounders in position, but
before the guns could be reloaded the walls were scaled and the fort
captured at three o’clock <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> on Dec. 14, 1774. The result was the
possession of one hundred barrels of powder, sixty muskets, sixteen
cannon, and other valuable stores.</p>

<p class='c007'>In his letter to General Gage informing him of the event, Governor
Wentworth said, “The principal persons in this enormity are well
known.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He mentioned no names, but a little over two years later Peter
Livius, who was at the time of the capture, one of the Provincial
Councillors, wrote thus to John Sullivan in June, 1777: “You were
the first man in active rebellion, and drew with you the province you
live in. You will be one of the first sacrifices to the resentment
and justice of government; your family will be ruined and you must
die with ignominy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Belknap wrote that “Maj. John Sullivan and John Langdon distinguished
themselves as leaders in this affair.” Adams, in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>annals of Portsmouth, said it occurred “under the direction of Maj.
John Sullivan and Capt. John Langdon.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Sullivan himself said: “When I returned from Congress in 1774,
and saw the order of the British king and council prohibiting military
stores being sent to this country, I took alarm, clearly perceiving
the designs of the British ministry, and wrote several pieces upon the
necessity of securing military stores, which pieces were published in
several papers.” Quint said: “Sullivan, bold and daring, then an
active member of the Continental Congress, and well known throughout
the province by his leadership at the bar, had great influence.
The seizure of the munitions at the fort, though sudden at last, was
doubtless not without previous thought. The result of this act was
momentous. It was the first act of armed rebellion. It preceded
Concord and Lexington by four months of time. The captors of the
fort entered it against the fire of fieldpieces and muskets openly,
and in daylight they pulled down the royal flag, the first time in
American history. They gave three cheers in honor of their success.
They carried off a hundred barrels of gunpowder, some light guns
and small arms which, under the care of Sullivan, were taken up the
river, which was at that time covered with thick ice, through which a
channel had to be cut.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This bold and audacious act was deeply felt in Great Britain.
Conciliation was now out of the question. The king’s anger was
aroused. It was already bitter enough on account of the Massachusetts
troubles. Governor Wentworth issued threatening proclamations.</p>

<p class='c007'>He dismissed the offending major and captain from their posts in
the militia. In answer to his edict all persons in Durham holding
civil or military positions under the governor, headed by Sullivan,
assembled at the tavern on the green, and there publicly burned
their commissions and insignia of office. There was no further need
of secrecy. The die was cast and the leaders were well known.
The official positions, civil or military, held by many of those who
were principals in the affair, obliged them, up to this time, to act
with caution. After the burning, not of his ships, but of his commission,
Sullivan boldly stepped to the front. The very next day
after the capture of the powder he headed a body of men numbering
between three and four hundred from Durham and the adjoining
towns, and, marching to the Council Chamber, demanded an answer
to the question as to whether or not there were any ships or troops
expected here, or if the governor had written for any.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>His excellency meekly answered: “I know of none.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The greater part of the powder was stored in the basement of the
meeting-house in Durham. The balance, for safety, was distributed
in several places, some of it going to Exeter. That stored at Durham,
as well as another portion placed with Capt. John Demerritt,
was taken by the latter in his own ox-cart, under Sullivan’s direction,
to Cambridge, where it arrived barely in time to be dealt out to the
troops at Bunker Hill. Of how much value it was there and how
badly it was needed, is too well known to bear repetition. Without
it and lacking the men from the old Granite State accompanying
it, Bunker Hill would not have been such a serious affair for the
British army.</p>

<p class='c007'>In claiming the leadership for Sullivan in this affair there is no
desire to extol him at the expense of those with whom he was associated,—men
like Langdon, Weare, Bartlett, Thornton, Scammell,
Thompson, Folsom, Wentworth, Gilman, and others whose names
are now household words. The position was freely conceded by
them at the time, and acknowledged by the best informed to-day.
After the Lexington fight, and while Sullivan was in attendance at
the Second Continental Congress, the gallant young Scammell, who
was in his office in Durham, wrote him that, “when the horrid din of
civil carnage surprised us on the 20th of April, the universal cry was
‘Oh, if Major Sullivan was here!’ ‘I wish to God Major Sullivan
was here!’ ran through the distressed multitude.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Capt. Eleazer Bennett, who died in Durham in 1852, at the age
of one hundred and one, said “that at the time of the capture of the
powder he was in the employment of General Sullivan, at his mill at
Packer’s Falls, when word was brought in to come down to Durham,
to go to Portsmouth, and to get anybody else he could to come with
him.” So far as he could remember, the following persons were with
him: Maj. John Sullivan, Capt. Winborn Adams, Ebenezer Thompson,
John Demerritt, Alpheus and Jonathan Chesley, John Spencer,
Micah Davis, Isaac and Benjamin Small, Alexander Scammell,
John Griffin, James Underwood, and Eben Sullivan, the major’s
brother.</p>

<p class='c007'>On arriving at Portsmouth they were joined by John Langdon
with another party. They captured the fort, took the captain and
bound him, and frightened away the soldiers. In the fort they found
one hundred casks of powder and one hundred small arms. A portion
of the powder was taken by Major Demerritt to his house in
Madbury, but most of it was stored under the pulpit of the meeting-house
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>in Durham. On July 19, 1775, as a final proof of Sullivan’s
leadership in this movement, Matthew Patten, chairman of the committee
of safety for the county of Hillsborough, wrote to General
Sullivan congratulating him on his appointment to the rank of Brigadier-General,
in which he said: “An appointment which, as it distinguishes
your merit, so at the same time it reflects honor upon, and
shows the penetrating discernment of those truly eminent patriots
from whom you received it; nor are we less sanguine in our expectations
of the high advantages which must result under God to the
public by your military skill and courage, as you have been indefatigable
in attaining the first, and have given a recent instance of
the latter, to your great honor and reputation, in depriving our
enemies of the means of annoying us at Castle William and Mary,
and at the same time furnishing us with materials to defend our
invaluable rights and privileges. This, sir, must ever be had in remembrance,
and (amongst the actions of others, our heroes of 1775)
handed to the latest posterity. That the Almighty may direct your
counsels, be with you in the day of battle, and that you may be preserved
as a pattern to this people for many years to come, is our frequent
prayer.” In Sullivan’s reply he said: “It gives me great
pleasure to find so respectable a number of the worthy sons of freedom,
in the colony to which I belong, have so publicly given their
approbation of my conduct in assisting to secure the warlike stores
at Fort William and Mary, and thereby preventing these evils
which must have resulted from our enemies having possession of
them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Nothing further need be said regarding the value of the powder
captured on this occasion, or the boldness of the act itself. At Lexington
and Concord the British were the aggressors, the Americans
acting on the defensive; but at Newcastle the Americans were the
aggressors, made the attack boldly in the open day, and as Quint
said, “for the first time in American history the British flag was
torn down by men in armed rebellion.” John Sullivan’s history is
well known. He and his three brothers gave their best services to
the land of their birth, and in memory of those services the state of
New Hampshire erected a monument of Concord granite on the site
of the church in Durham, under which was stored the powder, and in
the presence of the governor, council, and other officials, state and
national, and a large concourse of people on Thursday, Sept. 27,
1894, the one hundredth anniversary of his death, dedicated it with
appropriate exercises. The inscription reads:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c008'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>IN MEMORY OF</div>
    <div>JOHN SULLIVAN.</div>
    <div class='c002'><em>Born Feb. 17, 1740.</em></div>
    <div><em>Died Jan. 23, 1795.</em></div>
    <div class='c003'>Erected by the State of New Hampshire upon the</div>
    <div>site of the Meeting-house under which was</div>
    <div>stored the gunpowder taken from</div>
    <div>Fort William and Mary.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The tributes paid to Sullivan’s worth on this occasion by every one
of the speakers were ungrudging and hearty. Professor Murkland
said: “This may never become a large community, but it will always
be exalted by its association with John Sullivan, lawyer, soldier,
statesman, and judge.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The plain granite shaft, inadequate as it may appear, will yet
serve, when we shall have been forgotten, to recall the life of one
who served his country so bravely and so well that he made slander
dumb and malice impotent.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Gov. John B. Smith said: “It is no invidious distinction to say
that of all the New Hampshire men of the Revolutionary period
Sullivan was not only peer, he was preëminently chief. His life is a
part of the country’s history, and now, by virtue of my office (an
office I am all the more proud to hold because John Sullivan filled
and honored it), I accept these grounds from the town of Durham,
and this monument from the committee in behalf of the state.”</p>

<p class='c007'>O’Meara said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c008'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Your deeds for all the land that hold your fame</div>
      <div class='line'>Shall link you now to love New Hampshire’s name,</div>
      <div class='line'>While throbs high manhood round her glistening hills—</div>
      <div class='line'>While patriot gleam or pristine glory thrills.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Dr. Quint said: “To John Sullivan, the man who in all the American
provinces was the first to take up arms against the king, New
Hampshire erects this monument of native granite.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Professor Hadley said: “Washington’s never-failing trust and ever-affectionate
respect are of themselves sufficient to prove their possessor’s
title clear to proud historic praise; and Sullivan’s name does
belong of right to that choice list of eminent commanders which
bears such other names as Greene and Knox, Steuben and Stark.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>Senator Chandler said: “John Sullivan was one of the finest characters
of the Revolution. A great general, and as a lawyer, a legislator,
a statesman, a governor, and a judge, ranked among the very
greatest men of the Revolutionary period. The luster in our annals
of the gift to our early glories, bestowed by Ireland in sending to us
the family of Sullivan, will never be obliterated or forgotten.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Senator Blair said: “There is no sphere of public life in which he
was not eminent, nor of private life in which he was not influential
and beloved. The whole list of Revolutionary worthies does not
furnish one name which, on the whole, shines more resplendently
in all the great department of public service than that of John
Sullivan.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Hon. Henry M. Baker said: “The influence of such a life never
dies. Seldom is it the fortune of any one to serve his country in
such diverse yet responsible positions as General Sullivan held and
honored. Still more rare to discharge every duty with such great
energy and ability.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Gov. Frederick Smythe said: “Wherever the rights of man are
recognized, and so long as government by the people shall endure,
the name of John Sullivan must be one of the imperishable, of those
who were not born to die.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Col. Daniel Hall said: “Sullivan is worthy of lasting commemoration
as one of the most serviceable of the men it was New Hampshire’s
great honor to contribute to the cause of American Independence.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Secretary of State Stearns wrote: “Sullivan was a born leader of
men, and preëminently a man for Revolutionary times. He was not
a slave to ancient forms and customs, ruthlessly trampling upon the
traditions of his time. He boldly assaulted the conservative barriers
that confined the people of New Hampshire within the pale of accustomed
usage.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He early declared for a free government for a free people. In the
march of events, when the people reached his early standpoint, the
Constitution of 1776 was drafted on the line of his suggestions.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is a century since the life of Sullivan was ended, and the qualities
of his character and the magnitude of his work were submitted
to the generous estimate of his fellow-men. His fame with the lapse
of time suffers no impairment. A brilliant and an accomplished
civilian, a distinguished lawyer, a matchless orator, a brave and an
able general, a senator, a magistrate, and a governor, he bore his
accumulating honors with modesty, and served the state which he
loved with the restless power of a vigorous and versatile mind. The
study of his life is instructive. Through the vista, obscured by a
century, we read the story of his time in the light of the undimmed
luster of his achievements.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>With tributes like these from the men who were associated with
John Sullivan in the struggle for independence, as well as from their
descendants who participated in the dedication of the monument to
his memory, we, who are members of the American-Irish Historical
Society, can well be proud of the character and the services of
Maj.-Gen. John Sullivan.</p>

<p class='c000'>Edward J. Brandon, Esq., city clerk of Cambridge, read the
following paper:</p>

<p class='c007'>On a certain April morning, one hundred and twenty-two years
ago, Samuel Adams prophetically remarked, “What a glorious
morning is this!” and, as I stand here, I cannot restrain the feeling
that the shade of that illustrious and honored American makes use
of the expression with much greater emphasis to-day.</p>

<p class='c007'>For the accomplishments of his country during the past four generations,
her marvelous strides in acquiring and attaining a potent
position among the world’s nations, the tremendous development
of her magnificent natural resources, the genius and perseverance
displayed by her children, the prosperity and importance of her institutions,
the advance of her people in culture, the triumph of her principles
of democracy, with its lesson to the world that “the people can
be trusted with their own,” are surely causes for congratulation and
satisfaction. And all this reality dates from an incident comparatively
slight in the world’s history, but which is an important epoch in the
story of America.</p>

<p class='c007'>The period of resistance by the Colonies to British tyranny antedates
April 19, 1775, by many years, but the culmination of a series
of oppressive acts was realized on that day, and in the exciting events
preceding and following the fight at Concord and Lexington, the
town of Cambridge acted well its part, and contributed its blood and
treasure to the common weal.</p>

<p class='c007'>All Cambridge knows and feels a glow of patriot’s pride in the
Declaration of Independence of the people of Cambridge, made
months in advance of the Declaration of the Continental Congress,
when the town instructed its representative that if the Provincial
Congress should for the safety of the Colonies declare them independent
of the Kingdom of Great Britain, “we, the said inhabitants,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>will solemnly engage with our lives and fortunes to support them in
the measure.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In all the preliminary work of the period Cambridge was active
and conspicuous, and the animosity aroused by the opposition of her
citizens doubtless inspired the hatred of the retreating soldiery of
Britain, and caused the shocking brutality which has been told and
so often retold. But the history of the time records all these events,
and it is needless for me to recite them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The British troops landed at Lechmere Point on the night of April
18, and marched across the marshes to the Milk Row Road in
Charlestown, now Somerville, thence by Beech Street and the present
Massachusetts Avenue to Menotomy, Lexington, and Concord.
Captain Thatcher and his Cambridge men were among the first to
rally for the public safety, and the militia of Cambridge improved
the opportunity to attest its loyalty to principle. The muster roll
shows that they marched on the alarm, and did service as far as
Concord.</p>

<p class='c007'>Paige, Cambridge’s historian, tells us that from Lexington line to
Beech Street the passage of the British troops in retreat was “through
a flame of fire.” Despite the fact that the conflict of this day is
generally known as Concord Fight or Lexington Battle, the carnage
in Cambridge was greater than in any other place, greater than in all
others combined; for, according to Rev. Samuel Abbott Smith, in his
address at West Cambridge, “at least twenty-two of the Americans,
and more than twice that number of the British, fell at West
Cambridge.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the fierceness of the conflict we can to-day present ocular proof.
The large number of bullet holes in the house then owned by Jacob
Watson, some of which may be seen at this time, is one indication of
the amount of fighting done in Cambridge; while the spoliation of
Cooper’s Tavern in Menotomy and the Memorial stones all along the
line of march teach the heat and bitterness of the strife. In our
ancient burial ground, by which Lord Percy’s battalion marched to
the relief, will be found a neat granite monument over the remains
of John Hicks, William Marcy, and Moses Richardson, and in memory
of these and of Jason Russell, Jabez Wyman, Jason Winship,
buried at Menotomy—men of Cambridge who fell in defense of the
liberty of the people.</p>

<p class='c007'>These things are the inspiration which the Cambridge boy and
girl breathe at every step, impelling influences to love of country and
fearlessness in her defense.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>The <cite>Journal of the Provincial Congress</cite> estimates the loss of property
in Lexington at £1761, in Cambridge at £1202, and in Concord
at £274.</p>

<p class='c007'>But when we consider these exciting events of that memorable day
and read the stories of individual heroism, we feel a particular pride
that our race was permitted to be a factor in the great result. It
would be to us a matter of sincere regret if Ireland, who had contributed
so much that was noble and sublime to the military history of
other nations, had been deprived of the opportunity to manifest her
sympathy by active participation in the “Lexington Fight.” More
especially as the feeling of the people of Ireland was well known to
Britain and Britain’s rulers, as is evident from the records of the
House of Parliament in 1775, where it is of record that Governor
Johnstone, in the debate at the opening of the session used these
words:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I maintain that the sense of the best and wisest men of the
country is on the side of the Americans; that three to one of the
people of Ireland are on their side; that the soldiers and sailors feel
an unwillingness to service; that you will never find the same exertion
of spirit in this as in other wars. I am well informed that the
four field officers in the four regiments now going from Ireland have
desired leave to retire or sell out.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Again, Mr. George Washington Parke Custis, the adopted son of
Washington, says that Ireland contributed men to the Continental
Army at the rate of 100 to 1 of any nation before the coming of the
French. General Lee—Light Horse Harry—said that one-half of
the Continental Army was derived from Ireland. It is an undoubted
fact that two hundred and fifty soldiers served in the Revolutionary
War who bore the Christian name of Patrick. It is also undoubted
that the rolls of the soldiers who served at Bunker Hill contained
over one hundred and fifty typical Irish names. Verplank referred
to the services of Irishmen in the Revolutionary War in these words:
“Both in that glorious struggle for independence and in our more
recent contest for American rights, England’s penal laws gave to
America the support of hundreds of thousands of brave hearts and
strong arms.” I might repeat many more instances did the time
permit. Sufficient to say that the opportunity was accorded to
Ireland’s sons to do glorious work in the first conflict of the
Revolution.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cullen says: “The Irish came into the full light of colonial history
at Lexington and Concord. The cry of Paul Revere roused them to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>take their share in the defense of the common cause. Among them
was Hugh Cargill, the Ballyshannon man. To his prompt response
Concord owed the safety of her records.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Rev. Mr. Maccarty is heard from in Worcester on that eventful
morning of April 19, 1775. Lincoln’s history of Worcester states
that as the minutemen were paraded on the green, under Capt.
Timothy Bigelow, a fervent prayer was offered up by Rev. Mr.
Maccarty, after which they took up their line of march.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Another prominent name in the accounts of Concord and Lexington
is Dr. Thomas Welsh, who was army surgeon to the patriots. He
it was who met brave Dr. Joseph Warren as he rode through Charlestown
at about 10 o’clock on the morning of that April day.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With the evidence of participation indisputable, cannot we of Irish
lineage feel the glory of this day as our own right, purchased by the
self-sacrificing effort of our predecessors?</p>

<p class='c007'>And can we not, in fullest measure, in dwelling on the great and
famous events of April 19, 1775, exclaim with America’s noble son,
“Thank God, I also am an American!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Cullen (pp. 86, 88) gives the following names found on the rolls of
minutemen at that period:</p>

<p class='c000'>Joseph Smith, Esq., of Lowell, read the following paper on
“The Irishman Ethnologically Considered.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>It is almost as hopeless a task to define an Irishman as it is to
give the dimensions of a perfume; for the Irishman is as evasive
and delusive, as pervasive and variable in type and character as the
sweetness rising from the glowing bed of flowers.</p>

<p class='c007'>If this society is to have a logical and reasonable plea for existence,
if its title of American-Irish is to mean anything, we must
reach some solid basis upon which to build our fabric; we must
agree upon an acceptable definition of what is an Irishman.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is what I shall try to do rather than attempt to show the
ethnical components that enter into the Irishman. I have gone
past the point in my speculations and theories on the Irishman where
I place much stress upon the racial elements that go to make the
Irish nation. We must start with these facts—the race and the
nation are two distinctly different things; the terms Celtic and Irish
are not synonymous.</p>

<p class='c007'>I will state, so as to avoid the polemics of ethnology, just a few
facts upon which all people are agreed, to explain why I attach so
little importance to the merely racial elements that go to make up a
nation. The islands of Ireland and Great Britain were at one time
peopled by the one race which was known variously as the Celtic,
Cymric, and Gaelic. By emigration, conquest, settlement, slavery,
and intermarriage, and all those causes that mix races, Dane, Norse,
German, Norman-French, Dutch, French, Walloon, and Flemish
were mingled and intermingled with the original race, the constituent
elements varying with time, place, and circumstances. So we
have to-day in Ireland, Scotland, Wales, and England four distinct
peoples different in characteristics, temperaments, thought, and methods,
peoples made up practically from the very same elements. As
the different sections of Great Britain are separated by purely artificial
frontiers, they do not differ as profoundly as do the people of
Ireland from those of the neighboring island. We observe in this
republic people who claim a direct descent from English and other
stocks producing a people as widely separated in thought, ideals,
and physical appearance, and other distinctive features from the
stock of the old countries as the Russian is from the Spaniard.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is clear to me that there are other and more potent elements
that make and differentiate peoples than mere racial admixtures.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Irish, though speaking the English tongue and living under
laws foreign to the instincts of the people, are a nation apart from
the English, hating intensely the tie that binds them, out of sympathy
with English ideas, ambitions, religions, and methods; and yet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>they are both the product of the same racial elements, the alleged
preponderance of the Celt in the Irish being largely a matter of
doubt and speculation.</p>

<p class='c007'>What is it, then, that makes this tremendous difference in the
two nations? What were the forces that were at work to produce
from the same ingredients such profoundly different results? That
is the question we must answer; and in answering it we will reach
the basic idea of this society. Let me try and answer it in my way,
and endeavor to show as simply as possible what an Irishman is.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are in England as well as in America, among that class that
for lack of a better term we must call Celtophobes, those who have
an original if unsatisfactory and unscientific way of answering this
question which adds to the accumulation of their stolen laurels and
seems to afford them much satisfaction. If an Irishman break the
record in science, art, literature, or any department of human activity,
he is at once classed as an Englishman in England, an American
in America; if, however, he merely break the Decalogue, the law, a
bank, or his mother’s heart, he must perforce be an Irishman. This
differentiation will not do for us, however.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are some things we must remember, for our work has to
bear the closest scrutiny and the most searching criticism.</p>

<p class='c007'>The characteristics which we deem essentially Irish are not distinctly
Irish; they are merely more widely distributed among the
Irish. Wit, humor, poesy, melancholy, loyalty to faith and fatherland,
patience under trial and hardship, daring in adventure, valor in battle,—these
are found in all lands, among all peoples, though the
Irish have displayed them so conspicuously in all the centuries that
some, aye, many of our own people have come to regard them as
exclusively theirs. While good blood will tell and bad, we must look
to other things, we must consider other causes than race and blood,
if we are to understand the workings of a mysterious Deity and learn
how he makes nations and differentiates peoples.</p>

<p class='c007'>The crude ore lies in the mines of the hills all over the earth,
potential in its possibilities, yet heavy, dull, inert, awaiting the day
when man shall dig it from its hiding place, try it in the fires of the
furnace, beat it on the anvil and transform it into the polished rail
that ties together the ends of civilization, that will shape it into the
massive engine that carries the fruits of industry and commerce to
the uttermost parts of the world, that moulds it into the type and
press that spreads intelligence and frees the soul, and that fashions
it into the sword that frees the slave. And as the ore, so is man;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>he must be tried in the fires to be re-made for the work he is to do.
The elements lie everywhere; circumstances and conditions weld
and mould him into nations. He may creep on into the centuries
dull, heavy, oppressed, carrying the thrall of the master, content that
he shall eat and drink and sleep in the peace of ignorance, content
that his master shall do his thinking and fighting, heedless who the
master is, for the hands of all are heavy; taking his religion and his
lot from him who rules and starves him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Others there are who have lived for centuries watching the tide of
civilization and the higher life sweep by them, too hotly engaged in
the struggle of life and death to snatch the prizes as they go by.
Such a land for the long centuries has been Ireland. Seven hundred
years has Ireland felt the edge of the sword, and for seven centuries
she has shown the naked breast and empty hand to the oppressor,
beaten but unsubdued.</p>

<p class='c007'>Into the fires of hate and oppression, into the hell of battle and
persecution, into the <em>inferno</em> of famine, misgovernment, robbery,
torture, and all the evils that cold, deliberate malice and wickedness
could invent, Celt and Saxon, Norman and French, Dane and Norse,
Englishman and Scotchman were thrown, to be fused and mingled,
that, in the cooling, God might draw from the ashes the Irishman.</p>

<p class='c007'>In all those long dark centuries his courage never failed, his hope
never dimmed, his faith in God never faltered; he never acknowledged
the right of might; he accepted nothing from the man who
boasted himself the conqueror of him who is to-day unconquered;
he believed the day would come, and it is coming, when the forces
of evil would sink beneath the scorn of the world.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this terrible school the Irishman was made; here was
learned the infinite patience of his kind; here was bred that
mental alertness, that wit and humor, tinged with the melancholy
the world calls typical; here he drank into his blood the courage
and flame and battle, that marches him to death with a song
and a laugh; here every fiber and tissue of his elemental parts
were made over, and upon the green sod, that blood-soaked
soil, he preserved the virtues of the man who lives with God and
nature.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>THIS IS THE IRISHMAN.</h3>

<p class='c011'>The man born on Irish soil, breathing Irish air, drinking in the
beauty of the hills and vales and streams and loughs of Ireland,
listening to whispering winds of Irish seas, hearing the story and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>legend of the Irish days long gone, his heart and soul responding to
the hopes of those around him, be his father English or Norman,
Scotch or Welsh, Dane or Norse, French or Dutch, that man will
grow into an Irishman. This is the verdict of history; this is the
experience of seven centuries. Let them come from where they
will, those who plunge into the Irish Lethe emerge on the other
bank Irishmen, better betimes than the son of the older race, more
Irish than the Irish.</p>

<p class='c007'>Conditions, climate, environment are more potent than blood;
they are the instruments with which God works. The normal man
born on Irish soil and growing to manhood on it is an Irishman.
Carry him to the most remote quarter of the earth, and he is still
Irish, and his children even to the tenth generation.</p>

<p class='c000'>On May 4, 1897, the sad tidings reached the society of the
death of Admiral Meade, the President of the society. He
was born in New York City, 1837; appointed midshipman
Oct. 2, 1850; first sea service in sloop-of-war <em>Preble</em>, 1851;
warrant as master and commission as lieutenant, 1858; lieutenant-commander,
1862; was a commander in 1870; commissioned
captain in 1880; became a commodore in 1892, and
rear-admiral in 1894; admitted to the society at its organization,
Jan. 20, 1897, and chosen President-General of the same,
being the first to hold the office.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Meade family has been to a wonderful extent identified
with the growth and development of our national life. A
glance at the societies of which Admiral Meade was a member,
will show the active and heroic part this family has taken in
every movement since the settlement of the land.</p>

Connecticut in 1637–38, and in 1639 were among the founders
of Guilford, Conn. John Meigs, 2d, was one of the patentees
of Guilford mentioned in the Charter granted by James II to
the town, May 25, 1685.</p>

<h4 class='c015'><em>Period 1775–83.</em></h4>

<p class='c014'>The patriot progeny of the above-named who made their
mark in the War of Independence were four brothers (sons
of Admiral Meade’s maternal great-great-grandfather, Return
Meigs, of Middletown, Conn., born 1708, died 1770) as follows:</p>

<p class='c000'>1) Col. Return Jonathan Meigs, of the 6th Connecticut line,
born 1740, died 1823. He was with Montgomery at Quebec,
having crossed the wilderness with Arnold, and he commanded
the expedition against Sag Harbor, May 21, 1777, which
destroyed the British vessels’ defenses and stores. He was
one of the four colonels that led the forlorn hope at the storming
of Stony Point, July 15, 1779, under General Wayne. He
figures as one of the best and most reliable soldiers of the
Revolution.</p>

<p class='c000'>3) Capt. John Meigs.</p>

<p class='c000'>4) Josiah Meigs, of Yale College. (Eighteen years of age
when Revolution broke out.)</p>

<p class='c000'>2. The Society of Colonial Wars, 1607–1775.</p>

<p class='c000'>Admiral Meade was the Deputy-Governor of the District of
Columbia Society.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Ancestors.</em> 1) Maj. Simon Willard, born 1605, died 1676.
(Son of Richard Willard, of Horsemonden, Kent, Esquire.)</p>

<p class='c000'>Simon Willard emigrated from England to America in 1634,
and in 1635 was one of the founders of Concord in the colony
of Massachusetts Bay; deputy to the General Court, 1636–54;
assistant to governor and a councillor from 1654–76; commander-in-chief
of the expedition of the United Colonies
against Ninigret, Sachem of the Nyantics, 1655; led the heroic

lieutenant and captain of the Guilford Company; deputy to
the General Court of the Province of Connecticut in 1717–26.</p>

States of America.</p>

<p class='c006'>War of Independence.—War with Tripoli.—War of 1812.—War

<p class='c000'>Admiral Meade was Vice-Commander-General for Pennsylvania.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hereditary member by right of his father, Richard Worsam
Meade, 2d, who served as a lieutenant in the U. S. Navy, during
the Mexican War, on board of the U. S. frigate <em>Potomac</em>,
Captain Aulick, at Vera Cruz.</p>

<p class='c000'>Incidentally it may be said that Richard Worsam Meade, 1st,
was naval agent of the United States abroad, during the War of
Tripoli and War of 1812, and that George Meade (father of
R. W. Meade, 1st) was a prominent agitator against the Stamp
Act of 1765, and was one of the signers of the non-importation
resolutions of merchants of Philadelphia, Oct. 25, 1765, and
though a man of wealth, served as a private soldier in 3d
battalion of Col. Cadwalader’s regiment. He gave £2000 sterling
to the fund for Washington’s suffering army at Valley
Forge. Was a member of the Philadelphia “Associators”
during the Revolutionary War. Left the city when the British
army came in and did not return until Washington’s troops
reoccupied it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Admiral Meade is also a lineal descendant of John Benjamin
(gentleman), who came over from Wales, England, with Governor
Winthrop in 1630, and settled at Cambridge, Mass.
His son John removed to Connecticut. Admiral Meade’s great-great-grandfather,
Col. John Benjamin, of Stratford, served
in the War of Independence and received a British musket
ball in his shoulder at the battle of Ridgefield. His brother,
Col. Aaron Benjamin, of Stratford, was with Montgomery in
the expedition to Quebec, and in the battles of White Plains,
Princeton, Monmouth, Germantown, Fort Mifflin, Stony Point,
and at Valley Forge. He was more than one hundred times
under fire. At Stony Point, it is said, he was the second man
to enter the fort. He was lieutenant and adjutant during the
greater part of his service.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Admiral is also a lineal descendant of John Hopkins, of
Hartford, Conn., who came to America in 1630. This John
Hopkins is now alleged to have been one of the children (by
first wife) of Stephen Hopkins, who came over in the <em>Mayflower</em>,
1620, and was the fourteenth signer of the compact of the
Plymouth colonists. It is alleged (see the <cite>Signers of Mayflower
Compact</cite>, by A. A. Haxtun) that John Hopkins (of
Hartford) having a harsh stepmother, was left behind with his
dead mother’s relatives in England, but followed his father to
America in 1630, being then only seventeen years of age.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>Another line of descent is through Thomas Coates, who
came over with William Penn in 1682. The descendant of
this Thomas Coates was William Coates, of Philadelphia (a
colonel in the Revolution), and the great-great-grandfather of
the admiral.</p>

<p class='c000'>The council of the society, at its September meeting, was
entertained by the Rhode Island members at a banquet in
Pawtucket, at which Hon. Hugh J. Carroll presided. Mr.
Thomas Hamilton Murray delivered the following address of
welcome on that occasion:</p>

<p class='c007'>Gentlemen of the Council of the American-Irish Historical Society,—We
are glad to have the honor of your visit, and we hope that your
stay in Pawtucket will be pleasant to you and profitable to the great
movement in which you are engaged.</p>

<p class='c007'>The organization you represent seeks to write an unwritten chapter
of American history, an essential chapter which has been too long
ignored. Yet, until this chapter is written and its prime importance
recognized, American history as published will be radically defective.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every American, therefore, no matter what his ancestry and no
matter what his creed, must wish you Godspeed in your patriotic
labors.</p>

<p class='c007'>While supplying this missing chapter in American history, you
are at the same time helping to supply a missing chapter in Rhode
Island history.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Irish chapter in the history of Rhode Island has its roots
away back in the days of Roger Williams. But it is little known by
this generation. In the old colonial days men of Irish blood figured
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>prominently in this land of refuge. Like Williams and his colleagues,
they found here a haven of peace, found rest and freedom.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many soldiers of Irish birth or extraction battled during King
Philip’s War, 1675–76, in defense of the homes and lives of the
settlers. Not a few of them participated in the Great Swamp Fight
in Southern Rhode Island, and settled here when that war had ended.
We may mention as an interesting fact that an Irishman, Robert
Beers, was killed by the Indians in 1676 within a few miles of where
you meet to-night.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another Irishman, Charles Macarty (McCarthy), was one of the
founders in 1677 of our town of East Greenwich. The town of
Warren in this state was named in honor of an Irishman, Sir Peter
Warren, whose deeds of valor no word of ours need chronicle.</p>

<p class='c007'>Irish Rhode Islanders are heard from in the capture of Louisburg,
and there the bones of some of them repose to this day.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Revolution found among its most ardent supporters in Rhode
Island men of Irish lineage. The Blacks, the Dorrances, the Sterlings,
the Larkins, and a host of other people of Hibernian origin are evidence
of this.</p>

<p class='c007'>General Knox, a member of the Boston Charitable Irish Society,
was here during the early part of the Revolution; Gen. John Sullivan,
son of the Irish schoolmaster, commanded the Rhode Island Department
for a considerable period, and was in command of the patriot
forces at the siege of Newport and the battle that ensued. His
brother James, the Governor of Massachusetts, received in after years
the degree of LL.D. from Brown University.</p>

<p class='c007'>You see, therefore, gentlemen, that Rhode Island is rich in historic
material for your society. The shaft needs but be sunk to bring the
treasures to the surface. Your coming here on this occasion helps
to sink it.</p>

<p class='c007'>We Rhode Islanders are very proud of our little state. That much
of the Irish chapter in the history of this state is but little known
we acknowledge and regret.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yet some of it we do know. We recall many noble men that
Ireland has given us—Berkeley, McSparran, Brown, Jackson, and
the rest. We recall the Irishman Wilson, who was head of one of
the first free schools opened in Providence, and of those other Irish
schoolmasters here at an early day—Kelly, Reilly, Knox, Phelan.
May their memory be in benediction!</p>

<p class='c007'>We know, too, that Irish blood was not wanting in the veins of
Perry and of Burnside. At least two of our governors could truthfully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>claim an Irish ancestry on the one side or the other, and at least
three of our secretaries of state. We know that at the founding of
Rhode Island College, now Brown University, the first funds for the
institution came from Ireland, generously contributed by Irish men
and women.</p>

<p class='c007'>We are aware that many people of Irish extraction have married
into families of other extractions, some of these families representing
the oldest in the state. Thus we learn from the colonial and state
records that a Mahoney wedded an Olney, that a McGowan married
an Angell, that a McCarthy married a Maxson, that a Connor became
the wife of a Robinson, a McLoughlin the wife of a Steere, a Murphy
the husband of a Pitman. We see, moreover, that Prudence Mathewson
became Mrs. Kelley, that Harriet Thayer became Mrs. Patrick
Brown, that Rachel Aldrich wedded David Flynn.</p>

<p class='c007'>Patrick Cunningham, the records show, was married in Providence
to Mary Goddard; Sally Mahoney became the wife of Asa Capron.
The records further show the marriage of persons bearing the following
names: Heffernan and Coggeshall, Flanagan and Cornell, Riley
and Sabin, Fallon and Cook, Connor and Odlin, Burke and Greene,
Kenney and Chadwick, Mulholland and Hooper, Hurlihy and Thorp,
Carroll and Slater, O’Brien and Newcome, McGee and Perkins,
Donohue and Sutleff, Egan and Wilson, and a long list of others.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have already referred to the Olney name. I take it up again.
Thomas Olney came from England in 1635, and was one of the
original thirteen proprietors of Providence. His descendants are
widespread. Some of them were married as follows: Benjamin
Olney to Mary McFadyan, Sylvester Olney to Eliza McLaughlin,
Sylvanus Olney to Joanna W. Gorman, Frances M. Olney to J. P.
Mahan, George E. Olney to Mary E. Gilpatrick, Thomas D. Olney to
Mary A. Dunagan, Bradley Olney to Dora Fitzgerald, William N.
Olney to Mary Oday (O’Day), Amanda Olney to Jerry Mackay, Louis
B. Olney to Kitty Sheehan, Hattie M. Olney to Casper McManus.</p>

<p class='c007'>This indicates that the process of assimilation has been progressing
in Rhode Island for many generations, and that Irish blood courses
to-day through the veins of thousands of the old Rhode Island stock.</p>

<p class='c007'>These things we know, but there are many other facts just as
important we do not know.</p>

<p class='c007'>We depend upon you, gentlemen, and the society of which you are
the official representatives, to unroll the drapery so that our knowledge
may be greatly increased.</p>

<p class='c007'>Again we say, welcome to Pawtucket!</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>Addresses were made by Joseph Smith, of Lowell; James
Jeffrey Roche, of Boston; and Thomas B. Lawler, of
Worcester.</p>

<p class='c000'>On May 15, 1897, Hon. Edward A. Moseley, of Washington,
D. C., was chosen President-General of the society, to fill the
vacancy caused by the death of Admiral Meade.</p>

<p class='c000'>A committee of three Washington members of the society
was appointed to wait upon Mr. Moseley and officially notify
him of his selection. This committee consisted of Mr. J. D.
O’Connell of the U. S. Treasury Department; Paymaster
Carmody, U. S. N., and Capt. John M. Tobin.</p>

<p class='c000'>The committee had waited upon Mr. Moseley as instructed,
and Chairman O’Connell thus presented the matter:</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Moseley,—Complying with the directions of the Council of
the American-Irish Historical Society, we have come to announce to
you, in their name, your selection as President-General of the
society.</p>

<p class='c007'>To be the bearer of such information is generally a pleasant duty;
and it would be a pleasure to us in this instance, were it not for the
bereavement felt so keenly by every member of our society because
of the death of its first President-General, the late Richard W. Meade,
Rear-Admiral of the United States Navy—illustrious in name and
lineage and in the annals of his country.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is a great honor to you, sir, to have been selected by the
unanimous voice of our council to the highest office in our society,
in immediate succession to such an illustrious man. Nevertheless,
we hope that under your administration the society is destined to
grow with the growth and strengthen with the strength of the
Republic, and that it will eventually achieve the glorious object of
its institution, namely, to prove to the civilized world, and especially
to the “English-speaking peoples,” that there is no distinction of
blood or race among the colonists and their descendants who peopled
this part of the continent from Great Britain and Ireland; that they
and the succeeding and ever-increasing waves of immigration, up to
and long after the Revolutionary War, were all people of the same
mixture of blood—Celtic and Germanic; the Celtic—and in that
the Irish Celtic—then predominant, as it still continues to be in
every region of the globe where the English language is spoken;
predominant also on every ocean where floats our own flag, and the
flag of “our kin beyond the sea,” which bears the insignia of the
“three kingdoms”—a flag we do not now respect, and never shall
while it is the emblem of tyranny in any land or on any sea.</p>

  <h4 class='c015'><em>The President-General’s Reply.</em></h4>
</div>

<p class='c014'>President-General Moseley replied as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>Gentlemen,—Deeply appreciative as I am of the honor conferred
upon me by your tendering me the position of President-General of the
American-Irish Historical Society, I feel that the compliment is greatly
enhanced by my having been selected to fill the place so recently
made vacant by the death of one of our most illustrious fellow-citizens,
the late Rear-Admiral Richard W. Meade, of the United
States Navy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Honored by all true patriots for the loyalty, courage, and professional
ability which so eminently distinguished him in his country’s
hour of trial, and throughout his whole career, no more fitting representative
of the Irish people, to whose history our society is devoted,
could have been chosen as its first President-General, than Rear-Admiral
Meade, who bore a name renowned as well in the army as
in the navy of our country.</p>

<p class='c007'>While fully conscious of my being all too unworthy to occupy a
position which my predecessor so adequately filled, yet, as I am most
earnestly and heartily in sympathy with the objects of the American-Irish
Historical Society, and willing to share in its labors and responsibilities,
I cannot but accede to your wishes, whatever misgivings I
may have as to my ability to fulfill your expectations.</p>

<p class='c007'>My descent from Irish ancestry, of which I am justly proud, and
also from the English and Welsh, not only enables me to regard
myself as among typical Americans in respect of origin, as well as
aspirations and pride of country, but renders me fondly sympathetic
with the aims and purposes of this American-Irish Society.</p>

<p class='c007'>The main purpose of the American-Irish Historical Society is to
elucidate the history of the Irish element in our people and the
extent of the contributions to our development and civilization since
the earliest colonial period,—a rich and greatly neglected field for
historical research.</p>

<p class='c007'>The society intends to demonstrate the fact that this element has
not been given the credit which is its due by the writers of American
history, and to prove by authoritative records that from the earliest
days of the settlement of this country up to the present day, it has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>done its part towards establishing and maintaining this great Republic,
and in developing its greatness in every field of its achievements.</p>

<p class='c007'>But it is not solely to chronicle the deeds of Irish ancestors, or
their descendants, and our contemporaries that we have organized an
historical society.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ownership, or the right of possession, as well as pride of descent,
tend to make one a better citizen. We, therefore, desire that as our
young men grow up they may feel that they inherit the right of
ownership in our great country; that their ancestors have done their
part towards the up-building of the grandest nation upon earth—a
part not surpassed by any other element of our people, and therefore
that they should always exercise the right of citizenship as a sacred
trust transmitted to them for the glory and welfare of their country.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of all those who by immigration have helped to people our
country, the Irish have come imbued with the most intense feeling of
loyalty towards our institutions, and it may be safely asserted that,
since our independence of English rule was proclaimed, every true
Irishman has felt, on landing in America, that the American shore
was not a foreign shore for him. To perpetuate this feeling is the
crowning object for which the society is organized.</p>

<p class='c000'>Again sincerely thanking the society, through the committee,
for the honor conferred upon him, President-General Moseley
assured them that he would discharge the duties of the office to
the very best of his ability.</p>

<p class='c000'>In answer to the subjoined call the third meeting was held
Nov. 16, 1897.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Dear Sir</span>:—You are hereby notified that the third meeting of the
American-Irish Historical Society will be held at Young’s Hotel,
Boston, Mass., on Tuesday evening, Nov. 16, 1897.</p>

<p class='c007'>There will be a business session of the society at 6.30 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>,
followed, at 7.30 o’clock, by a dinner and post-prandial exercises of
an interesting nature.</p>

<p class='c007'>The after-dinner features will include:</p>

<p class='c012'>(1) An address by the presiding officer.</p>

<p class='c012'>(2) The reading of letters from distinguished members of the
society unable to be present.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>(3) A paper by Mr. Dennis Harvey Sheahan, of Providence,
R. I. (ex-clerk of the Rhode Island House of Representatives),
on “The Need of an Organization such as the A. I. H. S., and
its Scope.”</p>

<p class='c012'>(4) A congratulatory letter from His Excellency Elisha Dyer,

<p class='c012'>(6) A communication to the society from Hon. Joseph T.
Lawless, Secretary of State, Virginia.</p>

<p class='c012'>(7) A paper on “The O’Briens of Machias, in the Revolution,”
by Mr. H. W. Chaplin, of Boston, Mass., who is a descendant
of the O’Briens.</p>

<p class='c007'>Invitations to attend the dinner have been extended Rear-Admiral
Belknap, U. S. N.; Dr. John Sullivan, a descendant of Gen. John
Sullivan of the Revolution; and President Andrews, of Brown University.
President Andrews’s work on American history is well
known, and his patriotic address recently, before the Twentieth
Century Club, will not soon be forgotten.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is earnestly desired that every member of the society who can
possibly be present at the coming meeting will attend and help make
the event the great success it so richly deserves.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fraternally, and in behalf of the Executive Council of the Society,</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The third general meeting of the American-Irish Historical
Society was held at Young’s Hotel, Boston, on the evening of
November 16, about seventy members being in attendance.
Gen. James R. O’Beirne, Vice-President for New York, presided
at the business session. Secretary-General Thomas
Hamilton Murray made his official report, saying:</p>

<p class='c007'>The society is steadily growing in membership, and is receiving
an excellent class of active workers. Many of these new accessions
are gentlemen of national reputation. Before the year closes it is
expected that between five and six hundred members will have been
enrolled. Since the founding of the organization last January, three
members have died. They were Postmaster Coveney, of Boston;
Rear-Admiral Meade, who was the first President-General of the
society; and Lawrence J. Smith, of Lowell, Mass.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>Twenty-eight states, the District of Columbia, and two foreign
countries are now represented in the society’s membership. Since
the last gathering of the organization the council of the society
has held a number of meetings, and has materially furthered the
movement.</p>

<p class='c007'>The organization has enlisted widespread attention, and requests
for genealogical information, historical data and facts relating to
early Irish settlers in this country have been received almost daily.
Several of the society’s members are of Revolutionary stock, and
some are descendants of officers who served under Washington.
Some of the members, too, trace their American ancestry back to a
period anterior to King Philip’s War.</p>

<p class='c007'>Since the last meeting an excellent article descriptive of the
society and its purposes has been contributed to the <cite>Granite State
Monthly</cite>, of Concord, N. H., by the Treasurer-General, John C.
Linehan. A committee of Washington members of the society now
has in preparation a diploma of membership and a seal. This
committee will probably be ready to submit its designs at the next
meeting. The members at the national capital have extended the
society a cordial invitation to hold its coming meeting in that city,
and have, in fact, already begun preparations for the event, under
the direction of President-General Moseley. Gen. James R.
O’Beirne, on behalf of the New York members, has also tendered
the organization an invitation to meet in the near future in that city.</p>

<p class='c007'>The last meeting of the society’s council was held in Pawtucket,
R. I., as the guests of the members in that place and Providence.
The meeting was very profitable to the cause. Several new members
were obtained for the organization; and the entertainers’
hospitality was unbounded. The council has been invited to attend
similar gatherings in Worcester, Lawrence, and other cities. This
indicates the interest aroused. Massachusetts has at present the
largest representation in the society; then follow in order Maine,
New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, and Pennsylvania.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the conclusion of Mr. Murray’s report a committee of
three was appointed to take suitable action on the death of
Lawrence J. Smith, of Lowell, Mass. The committee consists
of Joseph Smith, Lowell; Thomas B. Lawler, Worcester; and
Capt. P. S. Curry, Lynn.</p>

<p class='c000'>William McConway, of Pittsburg, Pa., presented a check for
$50 to the society.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>It was voted to hold the next meeting of the society in New
York City.</p>

<p class='c000'>The business session then adjourned, and the company proceeded
to dinner.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hon. Thomas J. Gargan presided; and seated on his right
and left were John Mackinnon Robertson, of London; Admiral
Belknap, U. S. N.; Gen. J. R. O’Beirne, New York;
Hon. P. A. Collins, Boston; Col. John C. Linehan, Concord,
N. H.; Rev. Edward McSweeney, Bangor, Me.; James Jeffrey
Roche, of Boston; Thomas B. Lawler, of Worcester; and
Joseph Smith, of Lowell.</p>

<p class='c000'>Around the tables were noted: the Revs. William P.
McQuaid, Boston; John Harty, Pawtucket, R. I.; J. H.
Lyons, Boston; Dr. W. D. Collins, Haverhill, Mass.; Dennis
H. Sheahan, Providence, R. I.; Stephen J. Casey, Providence;
Osborne Howes, Boston; Humphrey O’Sullivan, Lowell, Mass.;
J. F. Brennan, Peterboro, N. H.; Representative John Jolly,
Alderman Thomas O’Brien, and Hugh J. Lee, Pawtucket, R. I.;
Daniel Donovan, Timothy Donovan, and P. S. Curry, Lynn,
Mass.; Hon. Joseph H. O’Neil, Dr. William H. Grainger, Dr.
P. J. Timmins, M. A. Toland, Edward A. McLaughlin, M. J.
Jordan, Dr. P. F. Gavin, Charles E. S. MacCorry, Joseph P.
Flatley, Jeremiah W. Fogarty, all of Boston; Edmund Reardon,
Capt. J. F. Murray, and Edward M. Manning, of Cambridge,
Mass.; James Cunningham and Frank W. Cunningham,
of Portland, Me.; and many others.</p>

<p class='c000'>After dinner a short but stirring speech was made by the
presiding officer, Hon. Thomas J. Gargan, who said in part:</p>

<p class='c007'>It cannot be otherwise than interesting to analyze the materials
entering into the warp and woof of our democratic fabric. We are a
nation receiving emigrants from almost every country on the face of
the globe. We are endeavoring to amalgamate people of different
races, languages, and religions into a homogeneous mass, eliminating
all that is vicious, and so refining what is good, hoping to evolve the
best type of manhood and womanhood to be found in the coming
century.</p>

<p class='c007'>Doubtless the descendants of each race making contributions to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>our population will perform their share of the work in tracing their
early settlements and their efforts in up-building the Republic. Our
share of the work is to examine the data and preserve the records of
the Irish and their descendants, and their contributions to the settlement
of the original Colonies, the founding of the nation, the upholding
of the Union, and the maintenance of democratic institutions.</p>

<p class='c007'>Proud of our ancestry, yet loving the United States and loyal to
our citizenship, we desire a fair share of credit for what they have
accomplished. We respect the Germans, the French, the Italians,
and the genuine Scotchman; but for that masquerading misnomer,
the Scotch-Irishman, who claims no ancestry and no country as his
own, we have only contempt; and he will go down to posterity as he
deserves, “unwept, unhonored, and unsung.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A distinguished man has said “the Irish have fought successfully
the battles of all countries but their own.” They have also
contributed their full share to the civilization and progress of all
English-speaking people. That they possess brilliant qualities is not
denied; but it is charged that they lack steadiness of purpose.
I think a careful and critical study of the history of this country
will refute this assertion.</p>

<p class='c007'>To assert that they have imperfections is but to say they are
human. For much of their humanity, I say God bless them. I wish
there was a little more humanity in the world in our day.</p>

<p class='c007'>We of this society are only asking that they may be spoken of
and written of impartially, truthfully. “Nothing extenuate, nor set
down aught in malice.” We will accept our share of just criticism.
The malice and insolence of ignorance have unfortunately held the
platform too long. It is our duty to endeavor to refute errors with
clear statements of cold facts. For such purposes this society was
organized; and it is very gratifying to be able to announce that in
ten months since its organization we have already a list of nearly
five hundred members coming from almost every state in the Union,
representing some of the most distinguished men and families of the
Republic. I congratulate you, fellow-members, on this signal success.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Gargan then introduced Mr. John Mackinnon Robertson,
of London, author of many striking books and pamphlets,
but most widely and favorably known to members of the
Society and Irish-Americans generally by his masterly work,
<cite>The Saxon and the Celt</cite>. Mr. Robertson is a tall, handsome man
of forty, with dark hair, moustache and beard, and a well-modulated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>voice, which without effort reached the furthest part of
the room. He gesticulates very seldom, and uses none of the
tricks of the practiced orator; but he held his audience in
rapt attention throughout his whole discourse, evoking applause
and laughter at frequent intervals. He is a firm believer in
the ultimate and not far distant triumph of Home Rule; and
his advice to the American friends of the cause had the merit
of novelty at least.</p>

<h3 class='c010'><span class='sc'>Mr. Robertson’s Address.</span></h3>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Robertson expressed the satisfaction with which he
found himself at a union of an Irish society whose purpose was
the systematic and dispassionate study of a department of the
history of the race. The new movement was the more hopeful,
seeing that it proceeded on democratic lines. It was said
that war could not be carried on by a committee. If the
military gentlemen present would forgive him, he would confess
that he wished it could not be done in any other way,
either (laughter); but he was sure that historical research
could very well be so carried on. In so far as the Nationalist
movement had of late years lost headway, it could fairly be
said that it was because of an imperfect application of the
spirit of democracy in its ranks. A great man was at once
one of the greatest boons that could befall any cause, and one
of the greatest dangers, because where the great man was all
in all, the powers of the lesser men were undeveloped, and
their faculty of coöperation was in a measure destroyed. The
Nationalist movement had been shattered somewhat as the
party of Cromwell was shattered at his death; but it would
find the cure which, in the old case, had not been forthcoming
(applause). Every development of democratic methods would
make for reconstruction.</p>

<p class='c000'>Above all, the present movement was full of promise,
because it was essentially scientific in its aim.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dennis Harvey Sheahan, of Providence, R. I., read the
following paper on “The Need of an Organization such as
the American-Irish Historical Society, and its Scope”:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>The history of a country is dear to the heart of the lover of that
country. By the aid of historical study we learn of the origin,
growth, and development of a race of people; their customs, religions,
laws, governments; their accomplishments and what they have contributed
to the economy of the world. The historian points out the
past to the present and future. He puts aside the veil that has
gathered about the dim past, opens up to the gaze of the bright
present the panorama of human achievement, and blazes the way for
his successor in the rosy future.</p>

<p class='c007'>What the clergyman learns from the theological disputations of the
past, the poring monk has gathered together; what the physician
now acquires with comparative ease is furnished him by the knowledge
garnered from the experience of his brethren from the time
when man learned that pain and aches affected his being; what the
lawyer gains from precedents is a guiding light which sheds its rays
upon problems of jurisprudence that the legal lore of the past generations
has taken from the leaves of experience; what formulæ the
scientist is able to demonstrate he owes to the observations of men
who, through the ages, have chronicled the phenomena of nature;
the statesman is able to meet the crises of the present by being
informed as to other crises in governmental affairs.</p>

<p class='c007'>The citizen of a republic who neglects to learn the fundamental
principles upon which rest the laws of the land, who does not know
how the country was developed and maintained, is as a blind man,
and is not able to bring to the exercise of his suffrage the amount of
intelligence that the country has a right to require from him.</p>

<p class='c007'>This obligation comes to us in a twofold capacity. We, as citizens
of this great Republic, should study the history of our country from
a patriotic standpoint, while as Irishmen, or descendants of that
race, it should be not only a duty but a pleasure to learn of the
deeds of Irishmen in America.</p>

<p class='c007'>Therefore, an organization such as the American-Irish Historical
Society, if it had no other <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">raison d’être</span></i>, would accomplish a patriotic
purpose if it served only as an incentive to the study of the deeds
of Irishmen in America.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has become almost a maxim in historical matters that the history
of events cannot be accepted as facts until the generation which
lived at the time said events occurred has passed away.</p>

<p class='c007'>The passions, influences, and conditions which generate, shape,
and control events lend a coloring to their recital which, deep-lined
or faint as painted by the writer at the time, are toned down or made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>stronger by the historian of a future generation who, unmindful of
passions, influences, or conditions, and with an eye single to the
preservation of history by means of the truth, makes past occurrences
stand out in their true light.</p>

<p class='c007'>Deeds that have received but a passing mention from writers
whose minds were biased are rescued from an unmerited insignificance
and placed high in the Temple of Fame, while highly extolled
acts, given an undue prominence by a partisan writer, are consigned
to a merited oblivion by the historian of a later but more impartial
epoch.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not often true of history that the stone which was rejected by
the builder becomes the corner stone of the edifice.</p>

<p class='c007'>A member of the Society of Friends who desires to familiarize
himself with the history of his sect in New England would find but
little of the truth in the writings which have come from such intellectual
dyspeptics as Cotton Mather and his disciples. But in the
unwritten history of Quaker persecutions that have become legendary,
by the purity of their lives, by their nobility of character and their
Christianizing influences, the pioneers of that faith stand out in bold
relief in the religious history of Puritan New England, with its dark
background of scourging, mutilation, banishments, and hangings.</p>

<p class='c007'>By analogy, how can the Irish-American race expect that the history
of Irishmen in New England can be presented in just proportion
to the true merits of the case?</p>

<p class='c007'>In fact, who has heard much of Irishmen in New England until
the present generation? As in New England, so throughout the
Colonies. The Virginia Cavalier was not less hostile to the Irish than
the Massachusetts Puritan.</p>

<p class='c007'>Should the American-Irish Historical Society go out of existence
to-night, it would have already accomplished a grand mission in this:
that it has brought forth from obscure records the deeds of Irishmen
in America, and has laid the foundation for the erection of an historical
monument to Irishmen that, with its base laid in colonial
times, and still being constructed, challenges the respect and admiration
of all lovers of American history.</p>

<p class='c007'>The work of this society has been thus far practically confined to
research of New England records. This research has been fruitful
of good results.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among other things we learn of the Irish as brickmakers of
Rehoboth and settlers in Salem and Lynn in early colonial
times.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>Again, we learn that the Irish in the Granite State had become so
numerous in colonial times that the General Court of Massachusetts
passed a law prohibiting the “wild Irishmen of New Hampshire”
from coming across the state line, lest they should drive out the
people of the older colony. As long as that state shall last the glory
and the fame of the Sullivans and their contemporaries of the Irish
race will remain illustrious.</p>

<p class='c007'>The history of Irishmen in Maine will be dwelt upon in the
address of one of the gentlemen who is to follow on the program.</p>

<p class='c007'>This research has extracted from the records of Rhode Island the
influence of the Irish schoolmaster, McSparren, in moulding the
intellectual development of that colony; it has called attention to
the work of Bishop Berkely in the promotion of education there,
and what is to me, personally, exceedingly pleasant information,
that Brown University, my beloved Alma Mater, in its infancy was
succored by the contributions of worthy people residing in Ireland.</p>

<p class='c007'>The work of presenting to the world the achievements of Irishmen
in America, in its just proportion to the achievements of men
of other races in the colonization, struggle for independence, and the
creation of a republic, the development of that republic from a
theory into a concrete nation, and the perpetuation of that nation,
is a duty not only to the men whose deeds are to be chronicled, but
also a debt which we owe to ourselves, which we should cheerfully
assume.</p>

<p class='c007'>The labor involved in this from its very nature is such as can only
be performed by an organization such as the American-Irish Historical
Society.</p>

<p class='c007'>The true status of the Irish in America, notwithstanding the fact
that their brain and brawn have been interwoven in the woof and
web of our nation’s fabric, has never been fully appreciated, by
reason of the prejudices which have been associated with anything
that bore an Irish name. This prejudice, in no small part, arose
from misconception and misunderstanding of the Irish nature, temperament,
and characteristics. There is a brand of bigotry that is
sometimes designated as inborn. In the case of a bigot whose
bigotry is congenital, it is well to follow the scriptural injunction to
reason not with a fool lest he grow wise. But in the case of those
persons who, by reason of misconception or want of acquaintance
with Irishmen, cannot properly estimate our race, yet whose minds
are broad enough to cherish the worth of a man when demonstrated,
and whose patriotism counts every man a friend who has contributed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>to the glory of his country, an impartial history of the deeds of
Irishmen in America would effectively serve to displace any prejudice.</p>

<p class='c007'>What lover of the human race, animated by that noble sentiment
of Terence, “I am a man, and I think nothing human foreign to
me,” can fail to appreciate the sturdy virtues of the Irish people in
America, their patient industry, their obedience to constituted
authority, their domestic constancy, their desire to provide homes for
their families and education for their children?</p>

<p class='c007'>What patriotic American can fail to be moved by emotions of
gratitude when he learns among other facts that the Irish in Ireland
assisted with food and provisions the struggling settlers of Boston in
a time of dire distress; that Irishmen of Philadelphia contributed
large sums of money to the famished Revolutionary heroes at Valley
Forge; that George Washington considered himself honored in being
elected a member of an Irish society; that nine of the signers of the
Declaration of Independence were men of Irish blood; that on the
field of war, and in the council chamber of the nation, as well as in
the administration of national, state, and municipal affairs, from the
time of our earliest history to the present time, men of that race
have given their lives and property to the nation’s cause? The work
of this society thus far in this direction gives promise of either
destroying the prejudices that have hitherto existed against the Irish
people, or removing the venom from the fangs of bigotry.</p>

<p class='c007'>To my mind the most urgent need of a society of this nature is
the means it affords of preserving Irish history in America. It
would be a great misfortune if the history of the Irish people in
America, at present fragmentary at best, yet gathered together under
favorable conditions and after the most careful and painstaking
labor, could not find some secure lodgment.</p>

<p class='c007'>What more suitable abiding place than the cabinet of the American-Irish
Historical Society, from whence it could find its way into the
private and public libraries, not only of our own country, but of the
civilized world?</p>

<p class='c007'>This society in the short time it has been in existence has accomplished
so much in its chosen field as already to have demonstrated
quite clearly its scope. From the publications issued by its members,
notably the work of our Secretary-General in Massachusetts and
Rhode Island, General Linehan in New Hampshire, Senator Walsh
in Georgia, Hon. Joseph T. Lawless in Virginia, and others, our society
has already contributed a fund of rich historical value to the history
of this country. It would suffice to cite this labor to show the scope.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>The thought has occurred to me that it might be well, however, to
suggest a specialization of this work and to provide avenues for its
dissemination. The society should pursue the line of procedure
already mapped out by extending its membership to every state in
the country. Membership should be selected from men of scholarly
attainments devoted to historical research. This membership should
be so catholic as to include men of all religious denominations and
nationalities.</p>

<p class='c007'>Apropos of this I beg leave to call attention to the great work
done and being done by German scholars in the study of Celtic, to
illustrate the probable value of assistance that might be rendered to
us by men of other nationalities. The society should coöperate with
the movements in the other states, looking to the establishment of
record commissions, and in states where such movements have not
been set on foot, to labor to create such movements. In addition to
this the products of the research of the society should be edited, and
when preserved in book form copies of these should be distributed
to other historical societies and placed in public and private libraries.
Volumes could be printed from time to time, a number of which
could be placed on the market for sale, thereby defraying the
expenses of publishing the same.</p>

<p class='c007'>With such an inviting field of labor spread out before us, this
society not only supplies a long-felt want, but also a means of inspiration.
Each member can contribute to the common fund of historical
data, and the sum total of these contributions will go to make up a
work of great value.</p>

<p class='c007'>The need of such an organization as the American-Irish Historical
Society being demonstrated, and its scope clearly defined, all that
remains to be done to perpetuate its success is to continue in the
work already so auspiciously undertaken.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following letter was read from President Andrews of

</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>My Dear Mr. Murray</span>:—Your American-Irish Historical Society
meeting is sure to be a most interesting one, and but for the condition
of my health and the numerous engagements for this month to
which I am already pledged, I should certainly attend. As it is, I
can only send you this testimonial of my interest in your organization
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>and in the important phase of our American history which it is
designed to investigate and expound.</p>

<p class='c007'>The society can, and no doubt will, perform a most valuable work.
The researches concerning the men whom I call the Irish Pilgrim
fathers—the earliest representatives of the Irish race in New England—which
you, yourself, sir, have so well begun, ought to be
carried to the utmost attainable completion.</p>

<p class='c007'>In early southern history Irishmen were a factor of the utmost
importance. The Irish settlers and settlements in North Carolina
and early Kentucky furnish an attractive subject for historical study,
which, I believe, has never yet been adequately dealt with.</p>

<p class='c007'>The American-Irish Historical Society will certainly prompt some
of the numerous and brilliant youth of Irish descent, now coming
forth from American colleges in such numbers, to turn their studies
in the direction named.</p>

your representative, Mr. Lawler. We fully appreciate the great value
of the work you have undertaken—a work that involves the preservation
of the record and achievements of men of Irish blood in the
building and preservation of the American Republic.</p>

<p class='c007'>The record of our race on this continent is glorious with patriotism
and self-sacrifice; it is a record of honest toil, of love of freedom
and religion, of devotion to God and country.</p>

<p class='c007'>In preserving an authentic account of these achievements, the
American-Irish Historical Society is performing a work of justice to

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>Hon. P. A. Collins and Gen. J. R. O’Beirne dissented,
courteously but firmly, from the proposition that justice is to
be won from England by patience and a campaign of education.
Recalling Parnell’s first visit to Boston, General Collins told with
impressiveness how Wendell Phillips attended the great meeting,
in order, as he said, “to look upon the man who had made
John Bull listen.” We must make John Bull listen, was the
theme of General Collins’s eloquent address. Though he had
come unprepared to speak, he was in excellent form and showed
no diminution of his old-time vigor and clearness of expression.</p>

<p class='c000'>General O’Beirne, whose erect, soldierly figure and noble countenance
“showed him no carpet-knight so trim, but in close
fight a warrior grim,” spoke with burning words of the cause
that is defeated but not lost, and never can be lost while Irishmen
preserve their racial character. History for seven hundred
years has shown their undying fortitude, and he predicted that
it would record the same through all the years to come, whether
Freedom come soon or late.</p>

<p class='c000'>Admiral Belknap, U. S. N., Rev. Edward McSweeney, of

<p class='c000'>On Feb. 1, 1898, the following invitation was issued to the
members:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Dear Sir</span>:—You are hereby notified that the annual meeting of
the American-Irish Historical Society will be held at the Hotel San
Remo, New York City, Thursday evening, Feb. 17, 1898.</p>

<p class='c007'>The San Remo is owned by a member of our society (Mr. Michael
Brennan) and is located at Central Park West, Seventy-fourth and
Seventy-fifth Streets. It is easy of access and excellently adapted to
a gathering such as we have in view.</p>

<p class='c007'>There will be a business session of the society at 7 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>, at which
the annual election of officers will take place. At 8 o’clock the
society and guests will proceed to dinner.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gen. James R. O’Beirne, Vice-President of our society for New
York State, will preside.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>The delegation from the New England states will include the Hon.
John C. Linehan, State Insurance Commissioner of New Hampshire;
the Hon. Thomas J. Gargan, Boston, ex-President of the Charitable
Irish Society (founded 1737); James Jeffrey Roche, LL.D., editor
of the Boston <cite>Pilot</cite>, and other prominent gentlemen.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the business session an amendment to Article XII of the
Constitution will be offered. This article at present provides that
the executive council of the society shall consist of <em>ten</em> members (in
addition to the general officers). The proposed amendment, if passed,
would change the language to read “not less than ten, nor more than
twenty.”</p>

<p class='c007'>During the post-prandial exercises Mr. Joseph Smith, secretary of
the Police Commission, Lowell, Mass., will read a paper on “American
History as it is Falsified.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The annual meeting of the American-Irish Historical Society
was held on Thursday evening, 17th inst., at the Hotel San
Remo, New York City. A large and representative gathering
was present. Six states,—New Hampshire, Massachusetts,
Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey,—sent
delegations. Fifteen states were represented by letters expressing
congratulations and good wishes.</p>

<p class='c000'>President-General Moseley, of Washington, D. C., was unable
to be present owing to a press of duties as secretary of the
Interstate Commerce Commission, but his annual address was
read to the society by Gen. James R. O’Beirne, Vice-President
for New York. It was an eloquent production.</p>

<p class='c000'>The society made its headquarters for the occasion at the
San Remo, a magnificent house, owned by a member of the
organization, Mr. Michael Brennan. It is situated at Central
Park West and Seventy-Fifth Street, and is one of the finest
hotels in the world. The banquet hall where the annual dinner
of the society took place is located on the tenth floor and was
lighted by over a thousand incandescent electric lamps. The
scene was one of great brilliancy.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>Among the early arrivals were: Hon. John C. Linehan,
Concord, N. H.; Hon. Thomas J. Gargan, Boston, Mass.;
Mr. James Jeffrey Roche, editor of <cite>The Pilot</cite>; Mr. T. B.
Fitzpatrick, of Brown, Durrell &amp; Co., Boston; Mr. Joseph P.
Flatley, Boston; Mr. Joseph F. Swords, Hartford, Conn.;
Dr. Thomas Addis Emmet, grandnephew of the Irish patriot,
Robert Emmet; Mr. Thomas B. Lawler, Worcester, Mass.;
Hon. John D. Crimmins, New York; Mr. Frank C. Travers,
New York; Capt. E. O’Meagher Condon, Washington, D. C.;
Mr. Stephen J. Geoghegan, New York; Thomas Dunn English,
Newark; and many others.</p>

<p class='c000'>The business meeting and annual election took place at 7.30
<span class='fss'>P.M.</span>, and was held in the grand ballroom of the San Remo,
which was comfortably filled.</p>

<p class='c000'>General O’Beirne called the assemblage to order. Secretary-General
Murray read the records of the previous meeting held
by the society in Boston, and the same were approved.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was announced that since that meeting three members of
the society had died. They were: Hon. Owen A. Galvin,
Boston; Hon. Charles B. Gafney, Rochester, N. H.; and
Hon. John Cochran, New York City.</p>

<p class='c000'>Committees were appointed to take suitable action on the
deceased members.</p>

<p class='c000'>The committee on audit, appointed to examine the books
of the Treasurer-General, consisted of Judge Wauhope Lynn,
New York; Mr. T. B. Lawler, Worcester, Mass.; and Mr.
Michael Brennan, New York. The committee reported the
books as displaying excellent system and arrangement, and the
accounts of receipts and expenditures as being in an eminently
satisfactory condition. The report was unanimously approved
and adopted.</p>

<p class='c000'>The society then proceeded to the election of new members,
and some thirty were admitted from New York, Virginia, Texas,
and other states. Among these new members is the Rev. Dr.
McComb, a Presbyterian minister of New York City.</p>

<p class='c000'>The proposed amendment to Article XII of the Constitution
was adopted. It provided for an increase of ten in the make-up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>of the council of the society. The new members elected to
the council under this provision comprise: Hon. Morgan J.
O’Brien, a Justice of the New York Supreme Court; Hon.
John D. Crimmins; Mr. Joseph F. Swords, Hartford, Conn.;
Dr. Thomas Addis Emmet, New York; Mr. Stephen J.
Geoghegan, Mr. Francis Higgins, Hon. James S. Coleman,
and F. C. Travers, New York City.</p>

<p class='c000'>In addition to the foregoing, the annual election resulted as
follows: President-General, Edward A. Moseley, Washington,
D. C.; Secretary-General, Thomas Hamilton Murray, Pawtucket,
R. I.; Treasurer-General, Hon. John C. Linehan,
Concord, N. H.; Librarian and Archivist, Thomas B. Lawler,
Worcester, Mass. These are all reëlections.</p>

<p class='c000'>After the transactions of some routine matters the business
meeting adjourned.</p>

<p class='c000'>A short time later the line was formed and marched to the
banquet hall, which was handsomely decorated. In the rear of
the presiding officer’s chair was a glory of flags in which the
star-spangled banner and the Irish tricolor predominated.
American and Irish flags of small size were also distributed
adown the tables, mingled with flowers and potted plants.
Overhead the effulgence of a thousand electric lights served
to add further brilliancy to the scene.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a bower composed of huge palms and smaller plants was
stationed an orchestra which discoursed sweet music during the
repast. The company around the board represented, without
exaggeration, several million dollars. Catholics and Protestants
were there, Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. It
was a remarkable gathering in many ways, and was indicative
of the strength and representative character already attained
by the society.</p>

<p class='c000'>General O’Beirne presided, and seated on his right and left
were Dr. Thomas Addis Emmet, Hon. Thomas Dunn English,
Hon. John D. Crimmins, Hon. Thomas J. Gargan, James
Jeffrey Roche, Joseph Smith, Judge Wauhope Lynn, Hon.
John C. Linehan, F. C. Travers, V. P. Travers, John Crane,
and T. B. Lawler.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>Also present were noted: Commissioner Coleman, New
York; Capt. E. T. McCrystal, of the Sixty-Ninth Regiment,
New York; Dr. T. F. Harrington and Dr. George Leahey,
Lowell, Mass.; Commissioner McSweeney, New York; W. F.
Foley, Houston, Texas; John J. Rooney; and about one
hundred others.</p>

<p class='c000'>The menu card was especially designed for the occasion and
elicited much favorable comment. During the evening a copy
of the first Yearbook of the society was presented to each
member present.</p>

<p class='c000'>A feature of the evening was the rendition by the orchestra
of “Ben Bolt,” out of compliment to the author, Dr. Thomas
Dunn English, who was present. He is now about eighty
years of age, and tears glistened in the old man’s eyes at this
thoughtful tribute. The post-prandial exercises were opened
by General O’Beirne who, after a stirring address on the objects
of the society, read the annual address of the President-General,
which was frequently applauded. He then successively
introduced the speakers of the evening, who were Dr.
Emmet, Dr. English, Mr. Gargan, Colonel Linehan, Captain
Condon, Judge Lynn, and a number of others.</p>

<p class='c000'>A great feature of this part of the program was an able
paper by Mr. Joseph Smith, on “American History as it is
Falsified.” He said:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Some Ways in which History is Falsified.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>When the American-Irish Historical Society was organized a year
ago in Boston, it declared its purpose to be the investigation into, and
the recording of, the influence of the Irish element in the up-building
of the American nation. We said then that the work and contributions
of the Irish race on this soil had received scant recognition
from the writers of American history; and we announced that
whether that omission sprang from carelessness, ignorance, indifference,
or design was not so important as the imperative necessity of
remedying such a state of affairs in the interest of historical accuracy
and racial fair play. For the past year our society has been in its
formative stages; in the coming years I have ample faith that numbers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>funds, earnestness, and enthusiasm will enable us to do our
work effectively.</p>

<p class='c007'>American history is being rewritten; the legendary and sentimental
method of writing it is growing in disfavor; a scientific age demands
the truth, and under its insistence new data are coming to light and
old myths are passing away. It is beginning to dawn on American
minds that this republic is the child of Europe and not of England;
that old man of buckram—the Anglo-Saxon—is having a hard
time with that new man of straw—the Scotch-Irishman; and when
science gets the latter on the dissecting table there won’t be much
left of him but rags and papier-maché.</p>

<p class='c007'>To-night I will try to direct your attention to “Some Ways in which
American History is Falsified”; and by falsification I do not mean so
much the deliberate perversion of facts as I do the false effects produced
by evasion, distortion, wrong point of view, and the physical
and mental limitations and defects of writers, which in their results
are quite as mischievous as those produced by perversion and
design.</p>

<p class='c007'>I will for my purposes group my object lessons under four heads,
illustrating each with a writer passing current as an historian.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. <em>Mental Invalidism.</em> The disease of certain literary doctrinaires
whose natural defects have been aggravated by education and fixed
by training. Prof. John W. Burgess, of Columbia University, is a
fine type of this arrogant school of dogmatism.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. <em>Legend and Sentiment.</em> The exploitation of legends, inherited
ideas, race and family myths, made current and passing into literature
by the efforts of those whose faith in folklore as historical data is
profound, and to whom facts and documentary evidence are unimportant.
Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, an amateur historian, is the
high priest of this cult; he is the custodian and incense swinger of
the deified Puritan, the marvel and fountain of the graces of the
modern age.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. <em>Imagination.</em> The school of writers who add to the gayety of
nations, who make history from their own inner consciousness, and
who record it as they imagine it ought to be, not as it is. Under
this head comes that humorless horde of scribblers, the Scotch-Irish
littérateurs, and the intellectual giant of Tennessee, Judge Temple,
author of <cite>Covenanter, Cavalier, Puritan</cite>.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. <em>Carelessness and Credulity.</em> Writers who accept any evidence
stated with solemnity and the air of authority, but who subject it to
no tests to ascertain its verity and genuineness. Under this head I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>take exceptions to the statements made by Prof. John Fiske in a
recent work, a writer hitherto regarded as safe and reliable.</p>

<p class='c007'>I will now devote a few minutes to a work entitled <cite>Political Science
and Constitutional Law</cite>, written by Prof. John W. Burgess, of Columbia
University, and designed to be a text-book for that and other
educational institutions.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Burgess is a rampant type of what a coldly critical and
remorselessly correct writer, John M. Robertson, of London, calls a
Celtophobe—a Celt hater. The learned Professor asserts dogmatically
that the Celt never has, never can, and never will amount to
anything nationally or politically; and that all law, order, and scientific
government have sprung from and are due to what he calls the
Teutonic races. Professor Burgess is a product of German training
and education, and his views have received the cordial endorsement
of such a calm and dispassionate authority as the London <cite>Times</cite>.
The careful writer in stating his theory will fortify it with facts and
figures and marshal his authorities before proceeding to erect a
fabric on it; but Professor Burgess isn’t that kind of a man. He
states his theory with an air of profound conviction and authority
and goes ahead. His theory, like a good many other fabrics “made
in Germany,” looks well, is calculated to deceive the unwary and
unthinking, but under very ordinary scrutiny proves to be very commonplace,
shoddy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Let me show you a few of the gems from his treasury:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Only the Teutonic races have produced national states....
The National State is thus the most modern and most complete solution
of the whole problem of political organization which the world
has as yet produced; and the fact that it is the creation of the
Teutonic political genius stamps the Teutonic races as the political
nations <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par excellence</span></i>, and authorizes them in the economy of the
world to assume the leadership in the establishment and administration
of states.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This brilliant outburst winds up a series of equally impressive
statements. Just what the Professor means by National States and
political nations I do not know, nor am I sure he knows himself.
At any rate, he appears to lay down a doctrine very delightful to
these governments which bully nations and steal territories, if not
quite so agreeable to those bullied and plundered.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now listen to his views on the unfortunate Celt; they have the
old familiar ring of anti-Irish hysteria, for which familiarity has bred
Irish contempt.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>“Personal attachment in small bodies to a chosen Chief is the
peculiar political trait of the Celtic nations.... The effect of
such a political character has always been the organization of the
Celtic nations into numberless petty military States, in each of
which individual rights have been ignored; between all of which
civil war has been the permanent status; and against which foreign
force has been continually successful.... Violence and Corruption
have always marked the politics of Celtic nations.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Let us stop for a moment to analyze this tremendous blast from
Columbia University, remembering that Germany and England are
Professor Burgess’s ideal Teutonic nations.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the time of the Roman retrocession from England until the
landing of William the Norman at Hastings, that unfortunate land
was in the hands of one of the dullest, most unimaginative, worst-governed,
and worst-governing races history mentions—the Saxons—for
six hundred years; it had become a congeries of warring, military
chieftainship, in which civilization was almost obliterated, learning
had disappeared, religion was at its lowest ebb, life and property
had no safety, the people were enslaved, and the coast harried by
foreign and victorious foes. The advent of a strong conqueror—a
mixed Celt and Norseman—changed all this, hammered England into
a strong military kingdom, connected her with the civilization that has
made the world what it is—the Latin—and did in six years what
the pure Teutonic race had signally failed to do in as many centuries.</p>

<p class='c007'>Prior to the historic event known as the Reformation, Germany
had as much peace as her neighbors—which wasn’t much—and all
she had she owed to her intercourse with the Latin South, to her
touch with the civilization and religion of Rome. After that event
Germany was torn into factions, military chiefs sprang up, petty military
states were made, violence and corruption were the rule, civilization
retrogressed, the people were degraded and the land devastated.
Germany was without unity; her mercenaries were for sale to the
highest bidder; she was terrible only to her children, the prey of
foreign forces, with civil war a permanent status. The advent
of Napoleon was a blessing; he hammered a lot of petty principalities
out of existence and formed two or three monarchies out of the
bewildering many. The fall of Napoleon saw Germany a confederation,
much after the fashion of pre-Reformation days, with Austria
on top. Again came wars and dissensions, and finally the strong
conqueror who united Germany against a common foe and made her
what she is to-day.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>Germany, I take it, is the highest political expression of the Teutonic
race, according to the dictum of Professor Burgess. What
is it?</p>

<p class='c007'>A military despotism of the most mediæval type, governed by an
autocrat of doubtful sanity, whose person is more sacred apparently
than that of the Deity; a land whence the people fly to seek safety,
peace, liberty; a government that is a constant threat to the peace
and civilization of the earth and that embodies all the reactionary
principles a free people hate.</p>

<p class='c007'>One does not expect the German professor, his disciple, or the
mole in the earth to see what is going on in the sunlight.</p>

<p class='c007'>If we turn to Ireland we see nothing but violence, corruption, and
plunder in the methods of the Teutonic race ruling there; and we
observe improvement in Irish affairs only with the decrease of English
influences and the increase of Irishmen in Irish affairs.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is a favorite axiom of the Teutonic writer of the Burgess type,
wherever English and German rule is a failure, that the people ruled
are unfit for government. Did it ever occur to them that the shoe is
on the other foot—they are unfit to govern?</p>

<p class='c007'>The unfitness of the English to govern Ireland is historic; it was
exhibited in America, as some may recall; it is notorious in India
and round the earth. The best-governed possessions of England
are the lands where Englishmen are least in evidence. Germany
in Africa is producing the usual harvest of Teutonic “genius”—depopulation
and devastation.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Mr. Burgess has a theory, and he does not propose to hamper
it with facts. He asserts that the government—the political organization—of
Spain, Italy, and Portugal are the results of Teutonic
genius. This will probably be news to the world; but if the debility,
decay, and general rottenness of those kingdoms are the result of
Teutonic genius, the sooner they try the genius of the negro and the
Chinaman the better for them. He covers whatever political good
may exist in Greece, Bulgaria, and Roumania by attributing it to the
impecunious German princes now adorning the rickety thrones in
those lands. The idea is original, but not impressive. Why not
attribute the political condition of Scandinavia to the presence on its
throne for ninety years of Bernadotte, the French (Celtic) military
adventurer, and his wife, the daughter of the Irish merchant Cleary,
and their children? The logic is as good, or as bad, in one case as
the other.</p>

<p class='c007'>But why go on with this tissue of professional rubbish?</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>Nations are made what they are by climate, environment, peace,
war, and economic and industrial conditions. Groups of men learn
as does the individual, in the school of experience. Nations have
no genius for anything; the botch work we call government to-day
at its best is hardly a manifestation of genius. Nations may have
temperaments, the product of experience, but only the individual has
character.</p>

<p class='c007'>Professor Burgess is merely a mental invalid, an hysterical Celtophobe.
He either forgets the existence of Rome and Greece, or he
fails to understand the value of civilization and human experience;
he is a kind of literary phonograph, repeating the slanders and
absurdities which a school of race egotists have raised to a cult. He
is a decidedly unsafe man to educate a coming generation of Americans,
for the writer of solemn and dogmatic nonsense is unfit to
train the American youth. Certainly no self-respecting man of
Irish-Celtic blood should permit his children to attend a university
where they are taught that the perpetrators of ages of outrage and
wrong are divinely selected beings, chosen “to assume leadership in
the establishment and administration of States.”</p>

<p class='c007'>If we desire that sort of rubbish taught, it is just as easy to secure
professors at Bloomingdale as it is at Columbia.</p>

<p class='c007'>The legendary and sentimental makers of history seem to thrive
best in New England; and a fine type of the cult is the so-called
“scholar in politics,” Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, of Massachusetts
and Nahant. There is in China a religion whose principal tenet is
the worship of ancestors, the placation of ancestral manes. This
religion is called Tavism; and possibly the purest type of Tavist,
outside of China, is the junior senator from Massachusetts.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Lodge is firmly convinced that the Puritan represents the
perfect type of man; that the history of the world began in 1620;
that the Puritan derived most of his excellence from being of English
blood; and that, while Puritans were Dutch, French, Scotch, and
even Irish, the lack of English blood somehow made them incomplete.
While the ordinary English Puritan was a wonderful personage,
the one who landed in Massachusetts was a genuine marvel,
but when he settled around Boston and Nahant, he began to
ooze genius and take on wings and halo. To this legend is added,
sometimes by direct statement and sometimes by implication, the
intelligence that all the great and good things that make this republic
different from and superior to other lands are due to the miraculous
powers of the Puritan. He is the creator of human freedom, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>father of religion, liberty, and tolerance, the founder and originator of
free schools, and the reputed author of so many ideas totally at variance
with his narrow creed that were he to rise from his bed of clay in New
England into the sunlight of to-day, he wouldn’t know himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is the school of historical incubation of which Mr. Lodge is
the high priest. Mr. Lodge has many admirable qualities; but his
mental vision is defective, strabismal, and his ancestral credulity
amazing. I am satisfied that Mr. Lodge would not <em>knowingly</em> do an
unjust, intolerable, or dishonorable thing; but he is so en-webbed in
tradition and so steeped in myth and legend that his rôle of historian
is a decided misfit. How else can we account for the absurd theories
he has exploited and the conception of historic events he has fathered
in literature?</p>

<p class='c007'>Anybody who has even read his history of the <cite>Thirteen Colonies</cite>
will learn that the success achieved in building them up was due to
the Puritans; and one is convinced that had some wandering vagabond
from Massachusetts been cast away on the coast of Spanish-America,
the Latin Republics south of us would now be the model
governments of the earth and probably be called “Anglo-Saxon”
nations. Everything that makes for success he attributes to the
Puritan; and he does it with such a solemn, awe-stricken lack of
humor that the irreverent are moved to Homeric mirth.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, as a matter of fact, the Puritan was a hard and fast bigot,
who hated and persecuted everybody who differed from him religiously,
and tolerated nobody; he was as priest-ridden as a Scotch Presbyterian,
and he set up a system of Church and State that amounted
almost to a theocracy. The climate and soil of New England made
him a hard worker; his environment and neighbors, a stout fighter;
but if his laws and records tell us any story, they say his morals and
practices were no better than they ought to have been.</p>

<p class='c007'>New England in colonial days produced some shrewd and levelheaded
men, but if she ever produced a great one, I have failed to
catch his name. When the hour of her struggle came the same
phenomenon was exhibited in New England as elsewhere in the
Colonies; her natural leaders, the people of education and wealth,
followed the fortunes of the oppressor, and the common people took
up the cause of freedom. New England in the Revolution did her
whole duty, but the other Colonies did not shirk, and furnished not
only men and money, but the theater of war.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Lodge is now furnishing “The Story of the Revolution” for
<cite>Scribner’s Magazine</cite>, and already we can see his peculiar defects of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>historical vision in what he has written. Here is a hint of his ideas:
“He [Washington] entered on the war with an army composed
wholly of New England men. He ended the Revolution with an
army, after seven years’ fighting, largely made up from the same New
England people.” He does not say so in so many words, but he
leads us to infer that the army between those two periods was made
up of New England men. This sort of writing is as absurd as it
would be to say New England did nothing. Has Mr. Lodge never
heard of the 40,000 men on the Revolutionary rolls of New York?
Has it ever occurred to him that Pennsylvania, Virginia, and other
Colonies furnished some men, money, and leaders? Have his historical
researches ever led him far enough to learn that Yorktown
might have been a waste of blood but for the armies and navies of
France? Does he know that the soldiers of America’s ally were the
regiments of a brigade immortalized on every battlefield of Europe,—the
Irish Brigade?</p>

<p class='c007'>It is very doubtful. I sometimes wonder if Mr. Lodge knew what
an Irishman was before he went into politics.</p>

<p class='c007'>In his account of Bunker Hill he hasn’t a word to say of Sullivan,
whose capture of Fort William and Mary with its supplies of
precious gunpowder made Bunker Hill possible; yet he has much to
say of the lack of powder during the siege of Boston.</p>

<p class='c007'>He says the American soldiers engaged at Bunker Hill were “of
almost pure English blood, with a slight mingling of Scotch-Irish
from Londonderry.” I note among the dead killed there the following
“Scotch-Irish” names: Broderick, Collins, Dalton, Dillon, Doyle,
French, Haggett, McGrath; and Washington, desirous of recognizing
this “Scotch” element in his army made St. Patrick the countersign
on a certain evening during the siege. I recall that it was this same
class of Irishmen with the Scotch prefix, from the New Hampshire
town of Londonderry, called after an Irish town of that name, and
which was originally planted by English and Irish, who insisted
upon double rations of whiskey to celebrate St. Patrick’s day before
Ticonderoga.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Lodge should learn to call a spade a spade, an Irishman an
Irishman, for we will. The desire of a certain class of people to call
themselves “Scotch-Irish” may be passed by with a smile; ignorance
and weakness deserve pity rather than censure; but we must
insist that the dead of our race shall be neither miscalled nor misrepresented,
and that their laurels shall not be filched nor their
glory stolen by those who have neither pride nor scruples.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>Whatever Irish came from New Hampshire—and the hills were
full of them—it would be a grave mistake to imagine that Massachusetts,
so English and so Puritan, did not have her share. The
Puritan Alva—Cromwell—and his villainous understrappers sent
many a thousand Irish victims to Massachusetts Bay as bondmen and
women; and voluntary immigration brought thousands of others.
The town records show this; and whole districts in western Massachusetts
were settled by them; and yet we are asked to believe that
when men cease to be Catholic Irishmen they become Scotch-Irishmen.
I can find no other excuse for the absurd title. Here are a
few of the “Scotch-Irish” names on the rolls of the minute men
of the day:</p>

<p class='c007'>It is well to note that the English parliament of that day was looking
keenly at the causes that cost England her mighty empire on this
continent; and apparently they underrated the influence of Mr.
Lodge’s Puritan in that struggle, and bitterly blamed the plain Irish
without any Scotchery.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Lodge means well; but folklore and history are two distinct
affairs.</p>

<p class='c007'>The imaginative school of history finds its best exemplar in a
gentleman from Tennessee, the home of the Cardiff giant, the Giascutus,
and the Scotch-Irishman. He is known as Judge Temple, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>has written a volume called <cite>Covenanter, Cavalier, Puritan</cite>,—a work
which has shaken the earth and spoiled the apple crop. The Judge
is original; he honors the Scotch-Irishman as he does all ghost
dancers, but he has discovered that all the might of the republic
sprang from the Covenanter. I know what a Covenanter used to
be, but I can’t solve this covenanter of Judge Temple. I can
explain him as he appears in this literary offspring of this intellectual
Cardiff giant. If an Irishman a few years ago did anything extraordinary,
wonderful, or notorious, he would have been a Scotch-Irishman;
in the Temple history he is a Covenanter; if he breaks a
bank, or a man’s head, or the Decalogue, he is merely an Irishman.
Apply that rule to all men and you have history as it is hatched out
in Tennessee. The Covenanter germ was born in Scotland and
spread over America, creating miracles. As the natives of North
Britain are not remarkable for national modesty and self-effacement,
I am puzzled to learn how this conversion of the world to freedom
and civilization has escaped the shrinking writers of Scotland. If
Judge Temple is not restrained by an injunction at an early date,
Professor Burgess and Senator Lodge will be compelled sorrowfully
to march on Washington, there to deposit in the National Museum
the Teutonic Genius and the Puritan Marvel; or they might be
turned over to some of the Yellow Sundays which specialize the
exploitation of freaks.</p>

<p class='c007'>Meantime we should keep our eye on Judge Temple, the young
Lochinvar of history, who has come out of the South.</p>

<p class='c007'>In <cite>Old Virginia and her Neighbors</cite>, Vol. II, p. 391, Prof. John
Fiske says: “Until recent years little has been written of the coming
of the so-called Scotch-Irish to America, and yet it is an event
of scarcely less importance than the exodus of English Puritans
to New England and that of English Cavaliers to Virginia. It is
impossible to understand the drift which American history, social and
political, has taken since the time of Andrew Jackson, without studying
the early life of the Scotch-Irish population of the Alleghany
region, the pioneers of the American backwoods. I do not mean to
be understood as saying that the whole of that population at the time
of the Revolution was Scotch-Irish, for there was a considerable
German element in it, besides an infusion of English moving inward
from the coast. But the Scotch-Irish element was more numerous
and far more important than all the rest.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who were the people called by this rather awkward compound
name Scotch-Irish? The answer carries us back to the year 1611,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>when James First began peopling Ulster with Colonists from Scotland
and the North of England. The plan was to put into Ireland a
Protestant population that might ultimately outnumber the Catholics
and become the controlling element in the country. <em>The settlers were
picked men and women of the most excellent sort.</em> By the middle of the
seventeenth century there were 300,000 of them in Ulster.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That province had been the most neglected part of the island, a
wilderness of bogs and fens; they transformed it into a garden.
They also established manufactures of woolen and linens which have
since been famous throughout the world. By the beginning of the
eighteenth century their numbers had risen to nearly a million.
Their social condition was not that of peasants; they were intelligent
yeomanry and artisans. In a document, signed in 1718 by a
miscellaneous group of 319 men, only thirteen made their mark,
while 306 wrote their names in full. Nothing like that could have
happened at that time in any other part of the British empire, hardly
even in New England.</p>

<p class='c007'>“When these people began coming to America, those families that
had been longest in Ireland had dwelt there but for three generations,
and confusion of mind seems to lurk in any nomenclature
which couples them with the true Irish. The antipathy between the
Scotch-Irish as a group and the true Irish as a group is, perhaps,
unsurpassed for bitterness and intensity. On the other hand, since
love laughs at feuds and schisms, intermarriages between the Colonists
of Ulster and the native Irish were by no means unusual, and
instances occur of Murphys and McManuses of the Presbyterian
faith. It was common in Ulster to allude to Presbyterians as
‘Scotch,’ to Roman Catholics as ‘Irish,’ and to members of the
English Church as ‘Protestants,’ without much reference to pedigree.
From this point of view the term ‘Scotch’ may be defensible,
provided we do not let it conceal the fact that the people to whom it
applied are for the most part Lowland-Scotch Presbyterians, very
slightly hibernicized in blood.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Again, “By 1719 this hope was torn away, and from that year until
the passage of the Toleration Act for Ireland in 1782, the people of
Ulster kept flocking to America. Of all the migrations to America
previous to the days of steamships this was far the largest in volume.
One week of 1727 landed six ship loads at Philadelphia. In the
two years 1773 and 1774 more than 30,000 came. In 1770 one-third
of the population of Pennsylvania was Scotch-Irish. Altogether
between 1730 and 1770, I think it probable that at least half a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>million of souls were transferred from Ulster to the American Colonies,
making not less than one-sixth of our population at the time of
the Revolution.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The merest examination of this will show that the writer is on
uncertain ground; he is begging the question; his own training and
education convince him that there is a false ring to the term “Scotch-Irish”;
the statements he makes, or quotes, show the earmarks of
that organized humbug the Scotch-Irish Society; and he is reluctant
to face the question squarely, and, by reversing the conventional concealments,
evasions, and falsifications which have marked the writing of
American history in the interest of the English element, acknowledge
the splendid work done by the Irish in America.</p>

<p class='c007'>Let us examine his statements in detail.</p>

<p class='c007'>Relative to Ulster settlement he says: “The settlers were picked
men and women of the most excellent sort. By the middle of the
seventeenth century there were 300,000 of them in Ulster. The province
was a wilderness of bogs and fens; they transformed it into a
garden. They also established manufactures of woolens and linens;
... they were intelligent yeomanry and artisans.”</p>

<p class='c007'>These extracts are the amusing myths of the Scotch-Irish Society.
We have an emigration from Scotland by, say 1650, of 300,000,
with no account of the English, French, Walloon, and German
emigrants who were introduced, and nothing said about the original
settlers of Ulster, the Irish. In 1659 Sir W. Petty, a government
official in Ulster, estimated the population as follows: Irish, 63,350;
English, Scotch, and other aliens, 40,571; a total of 103,921. It
is very possible that Sir W. Petty’s estimate was correct; that he
would find it very difficult to arrive at a correct estimate of the Irish;
and much more easy to get at the numbers of those who were naturally
the English supporters. It is well to recall that at the date of
this estimate Ireland had gone through the horrors of twelve years of
Civil War, marked by cruelty of the most ferocious kind; that the
Cromwellians had added deportation and slavery in the Americas
to their other crimes and abominations; that Cromwell had settled his
own soldiers on confiscated lands; and that he was not particularly
partial to the Scotch, whom he had fought and defeated, and whose
immigration he was not likely to encourage at a time when they were
parleying with the exiled Charles and plotting the downfall of the
Commonwealth.</p>

<p class='c007'>Professor Fiske’s 300,000 seem to vanish in smoke.</p>

<p class='c007'>The character of the population introduced into a country where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>the natives are treated as outlaws and wild beasts by the government,
is not hard to guess. It is not at all likely that it is going to consist
of model farmers, expert artisans, pious, educated, peaceful men and
women; that kind of people usually remain at home. The adventurer,
the ne’er-do-well, the poor, the desperate, the homeless; those
are the kind willing to face the hazards of war and fortune in a land
where the natives are hard fighters and haters of the government,
even though exhausted by war.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Rev. Andrew Stewart, Presbyterian pastor of Donaghadee
from 1645 to 1671, who was born and raised in Ulster, leaves this
record of Professor Fiske’s selected yeomanry and artisans:</p>

<p class='c007'>“From Scotland came many, and from England not a few; yet all
of them generally the scum of both nations, who for debt, or breaking,
or fleeing from justice, or seeking shelter, came hither, hoping
to be without fear of man’s justice in a land where there was nothing,
or but little as yet, of the fear of God.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Such were the selected yeomanry; selected evidently by the
king’s writ, by the beggarly planters who received the stolen lands
from a beggarly king, and by the London guides whose gold went
into the king’s pocket.</p>

<p class='c007'>The reverend gentleman gives us a further hint of the people who
came thus running from the sheriff and the heavy hand of the law.
He says: “In a few years there flocked such a multitude of people
from Scotland that the Counties of Down, Antrim, Londonderry,
etc., were in a good measure planted; yet most of the people made
up a body—and it is strange—of different names, nations, dialects,
tempers, and breeding, all void of Godliness, who seemed rather to
flee God in this enterprise, than to follow their mercy; albeit at first
it must be remembered that they cared little for any church.”</p>

<p class='c007'>People of many nations and dialects coming out of Scotland needs
an explanation. Mr. Motley, in his history of the Dutch Republic,
throws a great light on this subject. He says in effect that the
religious wars of Protestant and Catholic, and the persecutions growing
out of them of the ever-increasing sectaries, drove shoals of
artisans from Germany, Holland, and France to England. Elizabeth
of England had troubles of her own; and while she quarreled with
the Pope and disputed his headship, she was jealously insistent of
her own leadership of her state church and had no use for the pugnacious
sectaries from across the Channel. In time, owing to the
English jealousy of foreigners and rival manufacturers and the
Queen’s abhorrence of rebels against divinely selected kings, Elizabeth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>shut down on the refugees and refused them asylum. In those
days it was a much graver offense to insult the majesty of earth
than heaven. Scotland, then in the throes of religious squabbles
and the game of church plundering and under the practical guidance
of the amiable John Knox, gave them a welcome as kindred spirits.
When other days came, when Mary’s head had rolled from the block
at Fotheringay, when her wretched son was enthroned, the foreign
element found Scotland a poor land to live in. The settlement of
Ulster gave them their chance, and they flocked there with Scotchmen
and Englishmen, to settle down and intermarry and become—as
all before them had become at that Irish crucible—Irish.</p>

<p class='c007'>The forms of religious dissent driven out of Europe to Great
Britain, like Presbyterianism, had a common basis of agreement in
their common Calvinism, and the foreigners naturally drifted into
that form of ecclesiastical organization. Few went into the Anglican
State Church, and many of that faith drifted away from it to Catholicity
and Presbyterianism; and it was a special subject of reproach
later that the state-beneficed clergy caused such a state of affairs by
their indifference and greed.</p>

<p class='c007'>But it remains for American historians to find the terms race and
religion synonymous, and to advise an astonished world that when
an Irishman, Frenchman, Englishman, Dutchman, or Walloon, adopts
Presbyterianism as his religious faith, he is at once transformed into
that hyphenated hybrid, a Scotch-Irishman.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is one of the marvels of this inventive age.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before Professor Fiske—for whose talent and industry I have a
very great respect—gives us his promised views on the Scotch-Irishman
in his forthcoming work, <cite>The Dutch and Quaker Settlements
in America</cite>, let me propound a question or two to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>If, as is pretended, a certain number of Lowland Scotchmen of
the Presbyterian religion accomplished so much in Ulster and
America, why have not the great majority of the same people
accomplished as much in their own land and elsewhere, when all the
conditions were in their favor? And again, if so much was accomplished
by an Irish environment and an Irish racial admixture, and so
little achieved by the pure Scot under more favorable circumstances,
is it not a reasonable deduction that the Irish element was the
responsible factor in the achievement? If not, why not?</p>

<p>CAPT. JOHN DRUM, U. S. A.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>That invader and invaded should hate each other bitterly is not
of any particular importance as bearing on nationality; it is the experience
of all lands and races. Presbyterian Murphys and McManuses
are no argument for Scotch Murphys and McManuses; it may indicate
intermarriage and change of religious faith; it can’t indicate a change
of blood. The transformation of bogs and fens into gardens is merely
a fairy story; the bogs and fens are in Ulster to-day. The fertile
valleys of Ulster, ready to be entered on, were the bait to catch
settlers, for the defeated and disheartened native Irish had been
driven to the barren hills and bogs. Men as a rule don’t risk life
and fortune for the privilege of transforming bogs into gardens in a
hostile country; and, moreover, Motley says England and Scotland in
that age had the rudest system of agriculture in Europe. The higher
system of agriculture, as well as the woolen and linen industries,
came with the skilled exiles from Holland and France; and even as
great a plunderer as Wentworth was wise enough to foster them.
And I might ask, why didn’t these marvelous Scots make their own
country famous for woolen and linen industries, when they made
their own laws and could snap their fingers at English jealousy?</p>

<p class='c007'>Finally, if these people were Scotch “slightly hibernicized,” why
did they on their arrival in America organize “Irish societies”?
Why did they name towns and rivers with Irish names? Why did
they celebrate St. Patrick’s day rather than St. Andrew’s?</p>

<p class='c007'>It will pay Professor Fiske to examine into the Irish emigration of
the eighteenth century and learn, as less erudite people have done,
that as much of this stream flowed from Limerick, Cork, Waterford,
Dublin, and English Bristol as from Ulster; and that Leinster and
Munster poured in nearly as many Irish to Colonial America as did
the northern provinces. What he is unwittingly doing is settling up
the abhorrent dividing lines of religion and marking off our race into
“Irish-Irish” and “Scotch-Irish” upon the lines of Catholicity and
Protestantism. I as one of the Protestant Irish most strenuously
object; the name Irish was good enough for my fathers; their son is
proud to wear it as they did; and we must all insist that the Irish,
without prefixes, without hyphens, without any qualification, all
children of a common and well-loved motherland, shall be given
their full measure of credit for the splendid work done by the race in
America.</p>

<p class='c007'>If Professor Fiske is true to himself and the principles and canons
of his calling, he will find the truth and tell it, and waste no valuable
time chasing myths and will-o’-the-wisps.</p>

<p class='c000'>As an indication of the great interest of the occasion it may
be remarked that the exercises were not brought to a close
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>until 2.30 o’clock the next morning. Before adjourning, resolutions
of condolence on the loss of the U. S. S. <em>Maine</em> were
adopted by a standing vote, and the Secretary-General was
instructed to transmit a copy of the resolutions to the President
of the United States and to the Secretary of the Navy.</p>

<p class='c000'>On Friday afternoon the members of the society were given
a reception by Hon. John D. Crimmins, at his home, 40 East
68th Street. It was a most charming occasion. About
forty gentlemen attended, including Dr. Emmet and his son;
General O’Beirne and Captain McCrystal, of New York; and
P. J. Flatley, of Boston; Thomas Hamilton Murray, of Rhode
Island; J. F. Swords, of Hartford; O’Meagher Condon, of
Washington, D. C.; Joseph Smith, of Lowell, Mass.; James
Jeffrey Roche, Thomas B. Lawler, Michael Brennan, and many
others.</p>

<p class='c000'>The company first inspected Mr. Crimmins’s fine library and
were shown many books and manuscripts, some of them of
great rarity and value. A lunch was then served, after which
the visitors were shown the magnificent collection of paintings
for which Mr. Crimmins is so well known among lovers of art.</p>

<h3 class='c010'>THE AMERICAN-IRISH HISTORICAL SOCIETY.</h3>

<h4 class='c015'><em>When and where Founded.</em></h4>

<p class='c014'>The American-Irish Historical Society was founded on the evening
of Jan. 20, 1897, at a meeting called for that purpose, and
held in the Revere House, Boston, Mass. Over forty gentlemen
were present. The Hon. Thomas J. Gargan, of Boston, presided.
Thomas Hamilton Murray, then editor of the <cite>Daily Sun</cite>, Lawrence,
Mass., was secretary of the meeting. The provisional committee
that had attended to the preliminary work included Mr. Murray, just
mentioned; Mr. James Jeffrey Roche, editor of the Boston <cite>Pilot</cite>;
Mr. Joseph Smith, Secretary of the Police Commission, Lowell, Mass.;
Mr. Thomas B. Lawler, of the publishing house, Ginn &amp; Company,
Boston, Mass.; and Hon. John C. Linehan, State Insurance Commissioner,
Concord, N. H. Four states—Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>and Rhode Island—were represented among those in
attendance. Letters conveying good wishes were received from
Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia,
South Carolina, Georgia, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, and the District
of Columbia.</p>

<h4 class='c015'><em>Objects and Purposes.</em></h4>

<p class='c014'>The society is organized for the special study of the Irish element
in the composition of the American people; to investigate and record
the influence of this element in the up-building of the nation, and to
collect and publish facts relating to and illustrating that influence.
People of Irish blood have been coming to this continent, voluntarily
and otherwise, since the date of its earliest settlements. While they
have been a valuable addition to colony and republic in all departments
of human activity, their work and contributions have received
but scant recognition from chroniclers of American history. Whether
this omission springs from carelessness, ignorance, indifference, or
design is now of little moment. The fact that such a condition does
exist makes it imperative that it should be remedied. The society
purposes to remedy it.</p>

<h4 class='c015'><em>More in Detail.</em></h4>

<p class='c014'>Speaking more in detail, it may be stated that the objects and
purposes of the society are: The study of American history generally;
to investigate, specially, the Irish immigration to this country,
determine its numbers, examine the sources, learn the places of its
settlement, and estimate its influence on contemporary events in war,
legislation, religion, education, and other departments of activity;
to examine records of every character, wherever found, calculated to
throw light on the work of the Irish element in this broad land; to
endeavor to correct erroneous, distorted, and false views of history,
where they are known, and to substitute therefor the truth of history,
based on documentary evidence and the best and most reasonable
tradition in relation to the Irish in America; to place the result of
its historical investigations and researches in acceptable literary form;
to print, publish, and distribute its documents to libraries, institutions
of learning, and among its members, in order that the widest dissemination
of historical truth may be obtained; to do its work without
passion or prejudice; to view accomplished facts in the true scientific
historical spirit, and having reached the truth to give it to the
world.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>
  <h4 class='c015'><em>Membership Requirements.</em></h4>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Any person of good moral character who is interested in the special
work of the society shall be deemed eligible for membership in
the same. No tests other than that of character and devotion to the
society’s objects shall be applied to membership. The society comprises
life members and annual members and may also elect honorary
and corresponding members.</p>

<h4 class='c015'><em>The Mode of Admission.</em></h4>

<p class='c014'>The society believes that for the present as little red tape as possible
should prevail in the admission of applicants. A large membership
is desired. Consequently, a request to be enrolled, addressed
to the Secretary-General, to any of the members of the Executive
Council, or to a member of the society who is located in the neighborhood
of the applicant, will generally be sufficient to effect the
desired result.</p>

<h4 class='c015'><em>Non-Sectarian and Non-Political.</em></h4>

<p class='c014'>The society is constructed on a broad and liberal basis. It is
non-sectarian and non-political. Being an American organization in
spirit and principle, it greets and welcomes to its ranks Americans
of whatever race descent and of whatever creed who take an interest
in the special line of work for which the society is organized. It at
present includes Roman Catholics, Protestant Episcopalians, Methodists,
Presbyterians, Unitarians, and members of other denominations.
Catholic priests and Protestant ministers are on its roll. Republicans,
Democrats, and men of no political party affiliations are numbered
among its members.</p>

<h4 class='c015'><em>The Fees of Members.</em></h4>

<p class='c014'>Life members pay fifty dollars in advance at one time; they are
exempt from further membership dues. Annual members pay three
dollars per year each. For the present no initiation fee is required.
Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia are
already represented in the list of life members. The membership
roll also contains the names of gentlemen of the seventh, eighth, and
ninth American generations.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>
  <h4 class='c015'><em>The Society’s Officers.</em></h4>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The officers comprise a President-General, a Secretary-General, a
Treasurer-General, a Librarian and Archivist, an Historiographer
(not yet elected), and an Executive Council. The constitution also
provides for a Vice-President for each state and territory and for the
District of Columbia. It is proposed to eventually organize state
and city chapters of the society. A list of the present officers will
be found contained herein.</p>

<h4 class='c015'><em>The First President-General.</em></h4>

<p class='c014'>The first President-General of the society was Richard Worsam
Meade, 3d, Rear-Admiral, U. S. N. (retired). He was born in New
York City, Oct. 9, 1837, at the home of his maternal grandfather,
Judge Henry Meigs, which family has given many officers to the
United States Navy. He was the oldest son of the late Capt.
Richard Worsam Meade, 2d, U. S. N., and was a nephew of the late
Gen. George Gordon Meade, who for two years commanded the
Army of the Potomac. President-General Meade died in Washington,
D. C., May 4, 1897. His obsequies took place in that city. The
Society contributed a floral harp. Among the mourners there were
present from the society: Messrs. Edward A. Moseley, J. R. Carmody,
J. D. O’Connell, and Capt. John M. Tobin. The honorary bearers
were: Rear-Admiral John G. Walker, Commodore Charles S. Norton,
Admiral George Dewey, Commodore Norman H. Farquhar, Commodore
Winfield S. Schley, Capt. A. S. Crowinshield, Capt. Charles O’Neil,
U. S. N., and Col. Charles Heywood, United States Marine Corps.
Eight stalwart seamen bore the body. A battalion of marines from
the Washington barracks, under command of Capt. E. B. Robinson,
and a delegation from Lafayette Post of New York City, escorted
the body to Arlington, preceded by the United States Marine Band.</p>

<h4 class='c015'><em>Meetings and Field Day.</em></h4>

<p class='c014'>Provision is made for quarterly meetings of the society and
monthly meetings of the Executive Council. As far as possible,
each meeting, especially those of the Council, is held in a city or
state different from the one where the preceding meeting was held.
This prevents the society from becoming merely local to any one
state or city, and makes it what its founders intended it to be—a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>national body. A general field day of the organization is held annually
in the summer or fall. The annual meeting for the election of
officers is held in January.</p>

<h4 class='c015'><em>Diploma of Membership.</em></h4>

<p class='c014'>Each member will be entitled to a diploma of membership, bearing
the name of the society, the date of his admission, and such other
appropriate matter as may be decided upon. These certificates will
be signed by the President-General, the Secretary-General, the Treasurer-General,
and one or two other officers, and will be suitable for
display in office, library, or study.</p>

<h4 class='c015'><em>The Society’s Publications.</em></h4>

<p class='c014'>The publications of the society consist of two classes—regular
and special. A copy of every regular publication will be supplied
free to each member. Special publications will be supplied at the
actual cost price. Both classes of publications will contain a record
of the society’s proceedings, papers contributed by the members as
the result of original research, extracts from old documents bearing
upon the Irish in this country, or similar matter of interest, much of
it, indeed, of priceless value for preservation and reference. These
publications will be thoroughly indexed.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
